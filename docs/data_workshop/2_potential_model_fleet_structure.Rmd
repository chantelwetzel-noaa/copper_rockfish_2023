# Potential Model and Fleet Structure

The Stock Assessment Team (STAT) for the assessment of copper rockfish in California waters in 2023 currently plans on retaining the same model areas, split south and north of Point Conception, as was used in the 2021 assessments. This decision was primarily guided based on distinct differences in the commercial and recreational fisheries by area. Additionally, this approach provides the ability to easily account for differences in biological parameters and variable recruitment success by area. 

Currently, the following fleet structure is being considered for modeling commercial and recreational fisheries in both area models:
 
1. Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV, recorded as PC mode in RecFIN), 
2. Private Rental (PR mode in RecFIN),
3. Commercial Fleet Landing Dead Fish, and 
4. Commercial Fleet Landing Live Fish. 

Several factors have influenced the pre-preliminary fleet selection. First, there is a differential in size of fish landed live versus dead in the commerical fishery, particularly north of Point Conception that supports the need for separate selectivity curves. Second, both the CPFV and PR recreational fleets are expected to have corresponding fishery-dependent indices of abundance for consideration which requires separating these recreational modes into two fleets. Finally, the removals from the recreational shoreside and beach banks for copper rockfish are very small and do not justify a separate fleet. The minimal removals from these recreational modes will be added to the PR fleet to account for total mortality. 

The commercial lengths by year, particularly when divided into two fleets based on the landed fish condition (live or dead), are limited in recent years for each proposed model area. If there are issues estimating selectivity reliably for all model years, the two commercial fleets may be combined into a single fleet with selectivity estimated by a parameterization that would allow bimodal selectivity (multiple peaks in selectivity at size) using time blocks (e.g., one or more time blocks in recent years when the live fishery developed). 

Finally, each model area will have at least one fishery-independent fleet. The CCFRP survey will be included in the model north of Point Conception and potentially south of Point Conception depending upon the sample sizes. Additionally, south of Point Conception will include the NWFSC Hook and Line survey as a fleet in the model.
