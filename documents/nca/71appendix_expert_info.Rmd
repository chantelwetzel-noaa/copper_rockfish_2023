# Inforamtion Provided by the Commercial and Recreational Fleet Representatives


The copper rockfish STAT held the following three informal virtual meetings with stakeholders as part of the data exploration process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Copper Rockfish & the Commercial Fisheries on January 10, 2023 (24 attendees)
\item Copper Rockfish  & the Recreational Fishery South of Pt. Conception on January 23, 2023 (17 attendees)
\item  & the Recreational Fishery North of Pt. Conception on January 30, 2023 (19 attendees)
\end{enumerate}


A summary of the information learned is provided here.


Live fish fishery

To fish copper rockfish commercial in California a deeper nearshore permit is needed.  The trip limits of 75 pounds per two month period for copper rockfish has impacted the commercial fleet. Copper rockfish intended to be sold live, but do not live will still be sold as dead fish.  
North of \CapeM the commercial fleet is restricted to shallower than 30 fm.

Many of the live fish buyers transport fish to Las Vegas Nevada or Los Angeles and San Jose in California. 
The market is constantly in flux. 

In southern California, a large portion of the live fish fishery collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned. A fisherman's market in San Diego has allowed individuals ot sell fish to the public.




Commercial fishermen from multiple areas along the coast emphasized that the price difference for copper by size is not as pronounced as it is for other species landed live.  North of San Francisco, the commercial fleet encounters larger copper rockfish (~ 7 pounds) in general.  Fish smaller than 2.5 - 3 pounds (approximately 14-17 inches) are desired by the live-fish buyers and the restaurant market and will sell for a higher price, and the lager fish can be sold to the general public.

South of Point Conception, copper rockfish are not generally a target species for the live fishery and have been difficult to market. The majority of commercial caught copper rockfish in southern California are sold dead.  The price of a dead copper in San Diego is around $8 a pound.

North of Point Conception, copper rockfish is a target of the 
North of Cape Mendocino (\CapeM), live fish sell for 3-4 times the price of dead copper. For fishermen targetting black rockfish in the north copper rockfish are incidental catch and still sold. 

Historically (pre RCAs) copper were found predominately in 45-80 fm. 

Out of Morro Bay, coppers ranging betwen 1-6 pounds are most common in teh 10-15 fm range and also sell for $7-8 a pound.

Coppers are encountered at an average depth of 45 fm, but can be found out to 60 fm. Copper are rately seen outside of 60 fm.

Copper rockfish are "king" of the reef 

Copper rockfish will follow prey targets, especially the pelagic red crabs that have been observed farther north.

Part of the U.S. fleet fishes in Mexican waters. THere are soem areas of higher copper rockfish density targeted in Mexican waters. 
Onotogentic shift and seasonal movements. Copper also tend to move based on weather conditions. North of \PtC, coppers cannot be found during bad weather and seem to move to deeper waters (swell and wind). 

Can keep copper live from depths up to 60 fms with no issue and seem to be the hardiest of the rockfish species. 
marketing them in southern california to a species as close to a "grouper" (bocaccio rockfish) and is working.

Commercial fishermen interested in tagging fish they release.

Fishing is more consistent in Mexican waters.

In central California (near Morro Bay) the nearshore live fish live in the kelp beds and larger coppers on the outside edges of the reef - you can find larger coppers on isolaed outcrops. It's rare for the commercial live fleet to fish outsdie fo 90 fee, and in central Cliafornia it's harder to ekepe them alive and those exihibing barotrauma will die in the tank, and the price of live fish much higher.



Issues raised
Would liek to see regional management. Sampling of the commercial live fleet is prohibitive due to the high price of copper and the low quota.  Descending more fish now with the lower quotas.
How will the stock assessment account for closed areas? They would like to see some accounting for these areas in the models.

## Preferred Habitat 
Coppers are not caught in areas of high relief. They prefer aras of flatter, hard, or broken bottom, and will also be caught over soft bottom habitat. Coppers are "king" of the reef and seem to push other species off of the best habitat on a reef. 


Larger fish over soft bottom.



## Additional notes from the fishermen

Some of the webinar attendees participate in Cooperative Research, such as the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey, the CCFRP and the SWFSC Cooperative Sampling Program.

During the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, the have been times when the vermilion and widow rockfish are abundant and the lines are reeled in before even reaching the bottom.  


## Recreational Fishery

In 1997 there were 295 CPFVs in Califonria and in 2022 that number was 193 coastguard inspected active CPFVs that can carry 7 or more passengers. Of the 193 CPFVs in the state, 78 fish offshore exclusively.
