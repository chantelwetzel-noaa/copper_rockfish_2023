# Introduction

This assessment report describes the sub-area population of `r spp` (*Sebastes caurinus*) off the California coast `r area` in U.S. waters, using data through 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:ca-map}). The sub-area population south of Point Conception in California waters was also evaluated and is described in a separate assessment report. The `r spp` status for the California stock is determined by the combined estimates of spawning output from both sub-areas and is detailed in the [management](#management) Section. This assessment does not account for populations located in Mexican waters or other areas off the U.S. West Coast and assumes that these southern and northern populations do not contribute to nor take from the population being assessed here.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

Off the coast of California north of Point Conception, `r spp` is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality of `r spp` across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The recreational fishery is comprised of individual recreational fishers (Private/Rental, PR) and commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFV) also known as party/charter (PC) which take groups of individuals out for day fishing trips. Across both types of recreational fishing, the majority of effort occurs around rocky reefs that can be accessed via day-trips. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein <- file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'1_intro_ca_commercial.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

`r Spp` residing between Point Conception and the California/Oregon border are assessed here as a separate sub-area (Figure \ref{fig:ca-map}). This designation was made based on oceanographic, geographic, and fishery conditions. The `r spp` population in California waters was split at Point Conception due to water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish populations to the north and south. The northern border for this assessment was defined as the California/Oregon border due to substantial differences in historical and current exploitation levels. Additionally, the fairly sedentary nature of adult `r spp` likely limits flow of fish between south and north of Point Conception. 

## Summary of Management History and Performance


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text", '1_intro_management.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```
Most commercial catch of `r spp` since about 2000 has been from the hook and line gear type and thus the most impactful management actions have been non-trawl RCA depth adjustments. Adjustment of that boundary north of 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. in 2009, restricting the nearshore fishery to waters less than 20 fathoms from their previous 30 fathom allowance, may have resulted in a shift in the size of `r spp` being landed to smaller fish as the fleet adjusted and markets developed for smaller "plate-sized" fish within the live fishery.

# Data

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models. The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors. These factors often include, but are not limited to,
the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency); the spatial and temporal coverage of the data; the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit; the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance; timing of when the data were provided; limitations imposed by the Terms of Reference; and the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model. Attributes associated with a data source can change through time, as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes). Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for `r spp`. Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment it may provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model.
Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:data-plot)) and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. A map of the available fishery-dependent data considered and the expected range of copper rockfish by CDFW blocks is in Figure \@ref(fig:survey-map). Data that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or had not changed since their past exploration in a previous `r spp` stock assessment when they were not used. In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources was explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \@ref(assessment-model)).

## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery {#commercial-fishery}

#### Landings and Discards
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
general_wd = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text")
filein = file.path(general_wd,'2f_commercial_removals.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```


#### Composition Data 
\

Biological data were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System on March 20, 2023. Length data for the commercial fleet were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples from north of Point Conception beginning in 1978 (Tables \ref{tab:dead-com-len} and \ref{tab:live-com-len}). The commercial data was split by landed condition, live or dead, with the first data for the live fish fishery beginning in 1994. The number of length samples by fleet were highly variable with the largest number of samples by year being recorded in the 1990s for the dead fish fishery. In recent years, the number of length samples by year are limited for both fleets with annual sample sizes less than 100 per year. The number of samples prior to the 1990s and in the 2000s for the dead fish fishery were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations any years with less than 20 sampled fish were considered too sparse to accurately reflect the fleet selectivity for that year (see Appendix Section \ref{excluded-data} for implied fits to these lengths). 

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet landing dead `r spp` ranged between approximately 25 - 50 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-len-data}, detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}). Notably, fewer small fish were observed in the early years of data prior to 1990 compared to later years. The mean length observed by year ranged between approximately 30 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-dead-len-data}). The mean observed length since 2010 slowly increased through 2018 with a drop in the mean observed age in the most recent years data. The age data from 2019-2022 commercial dead fleet contained enough samples for inclusion in the model and show the preference for larger/older fish than encountered in the live fish fishery (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-age-data})

The observed distribution of sizes sampled from the commercial live fish fleet were generally variable prior to 2011 with the length distributions thereafter indicating a smaller range of sizes being landed (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-len-data}). The observed mean length of fish landed live also clearly shows a drop starting in 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-live-len-data}).  

The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

### Recreational Fishery {#recreational-fishery}

#### Landings and Discards
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
general_wd = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text")
filein = file.path(general_wd,'2f_recreational_removals.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

#### Indices of Abundance
\

A number of indices of abundance were explored for the recreational fleet. Discarded catch is available from onboard observer surveys, but was not included in indices. Indices developed for the assessment include:

* Deb-Wilson Vandenberg survey of the CPFV/PC fleet (1988-1998),
* CDFW CPFV/PC onboard observer index (2004-2019), and
* CRFS PR1 sites dockside survey (2004-2019).

Due to limited sampling during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inseason action taken by CDFW for 2022 reducing sub-bag limits for `r spp` across California, both recreational fishery indices of abundance excluded data collected after 2019.

The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data set originated from an onboard observer survey conducted by CDFW survey in California north of Point Conception from 1988-1998 and is referred to as the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey [@reilly_onboard_1998]. During an observer trip the sampler rode along on the CPFV and recorded location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people and the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measured retained and discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species. See Appendix Section \ref{dwv-cpfv-index} for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection. The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg CPFV index of abundance increased between 1988-1990 and then generally declined between 1991-1998 (Figure \ref{fig:dwv-index-main}).


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'21f_crfs_cpfv_index.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

The CRFS CPFV index of abundance was stable in the early years of the time series and then shifted upwards in 2016 and was stable until  2019 (Figure \ref{fig:crfs-index-main}). See Appendix Section \ref{onboard-cpfv-index} for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection.

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats from 2004-2019 and 2021-2022 were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e., effort units are angler trips), angler-reported distance from shore (Area X: inside/outside of 3 nm), county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. Only data through 2019 were used to develop an index of abundance due to potential changes in angler behavior in 2021 and management changes in 2022. See Appendix Section \ref{crfs-pr-index} for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection. The CRFS PR index of abundance generally increased between 2004-2016, with the final years of the index stabilizing or slightly declining (Figure \ref{fig:crfs-pr-index-main}).


#### Composition Data 
\

Length compositions were available from the following sources: 

* Recreational party/charter mode (CPFV/PC)

  + Miller and Gotshall dockside survey (1959-1961, 1966)
  + Don Pearson onboard PC survey (1978-1984)
  + MRFSS CPFV/PC dockside survey (1980-1989, 1993-2003)
  + CRFS CPFV/PC onboard dockside survey (2004-2022)
  + Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard CPFV survey (1988-1998)

* Recreational private/rental mode (PR)

  + Miller and Gotshall dockside PR survey (1959)
  + MRFSS dockside PR survey (1980-1989, 1993-2003)
  + CRFS dockside PR survey (2004-2022)
  
  
The number of available fish and unique trips by year and fleet are in Table \ref{tab:rec-len-samps}. MRFSS historical biological data were downloaded from the RecFIN website in December 2022. CRFS biological data were also downloaded from RecFIN on February 18, 2023. The Miller and Goshall, Don Pearson, and Deb Wilson-Vandenberg recreational survey data were downloaded from the SWFSC databases in February 2023. 

Between 1987-1989 and 1993-1998 there were recreational length data for the CPFV fleet from both MRFSS and the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data sets. During data exploration it was determined that the lengths in MRFSS from 1997 and 1998 were also included in the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data, indicating that these data sources were duplicated for these years but also potentially other years where they overlapped. In order to avoid duplicate data, the length data from MRFSS, which had far fewer length samples for the overlapping years with Deb Wilson-Vandenberg for the CPFV fleet, were removed from the data used within the model (see [Appendix A](#excluded-data) for implied fits to these lengths).

The majority of length samples for both recreational fleets, CPFV and PR, were unsexed. A wide range of sampled lengths from the recreational CPFV fleet were observed across all years with lengths generally ranging between 25 - 45 cm except for the late 1970s and early 1980s where a higher proportion of larger fish were sampled (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-len-data}). The mean of lengths observed in the recreational CPFV fleet since approximately the 1990s has been relatively stable, varying between 35 - 40 cm, with high variability within the data in the early years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-cpfv-len-data}). The range of lengths sampled from the recreational PR fleet are similar to those from the CPFV fleet with lengths in recent years ranging between 25 - 45 cm with a slightly larger proportion of larger fish observed in the 1980s (Figures \ref{fig:rec-pr-len-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rec-pr-len-data}). 

Age composition data were available for select years from both the recreational CPFV and PR fleets. Historical age data collected from the CPFV fishery were available from this fleet from  1978, 1981, and 1984. The majority of these fish were sexed (only 4 total unsexed ages from 1978 and 1984) with an average age ranging from 10 to 14 across these years (Figures \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-caal-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rec-cpfv-age-data}). The historical age data from this fleet were input as marginal ages. There were a total of 250 age samples from the final model year, 2022, collected by a cooperative sampling program with the fleet coordinated by the SWFSC (Figures \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-caal-data} and \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-marg-age-data}). These data were collected by three CPFV vessels that operate north of Point Conception following random sampling protocols. These same vessels are also observed by the CRFS onboard sampling program that collects length data. The cooperative ages were compared to all the CPFV lengths collected by the CRFS sampling program to ensure that the sampling was representative of the fleet as a whole (Figure \ref{fig:coop-len-comparison}). These ages were incorporated as either marginal or conditional age-at-length data depending upon how fish length was measured: carcass or whole fish. The carcass lengths were included as marginals in order to avoid any potential measurement bias in the use of these ages. Finally, a total of 139 ages were collected from the PR fleet in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-caal-data}). These data were used in the model as conditional age-at-length data as well.  

The approach to determine the number of unique trips by data source varied. Some data sources had unique trip numbers within the data (Don Pearson, Deb Wilson-Vandenberg). Other data sources that lacked a clear trip identifier used combinations of multiple fields to attempt to estimate unique combinations that represented the number of trips sampled. The number of trips for MRFSS data was estimated using the year, wave, ID code, sampling site (INSITE), area, and mode. A similar methodology was applied for the CRFS and Miller and Gotshall data, where county, water area, interview site, and mode were used to determine the number of unique trips.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Two fishery-independent data sources with indices of abundance were included in the base model. These surveys sampled rocky habitat across the area `r area` (Figure \ref{fig:survey-locations}) in both areas open to fishing (termed reference areas) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs, Figure \ref{fig:ref-mpa}).

<!--chapter:end:21s-.Rmd-->

### California Cooperative Fisheries Research Program Survey

#### Index of Abundance
\

Since 2007, the \gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \glspl{mpa} and understand nearshore fish populations [@starr_variation_2015; @wendt_collaborative_2009]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California (A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast. Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \glspl{cpfv} guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \glspl{mpa}. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and released or descended to depth; since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.

The CCFRP Hook and Line survey is one the longest fishery-independent time series available `r area` for nearshore rockfish, having occurred annually between 2007-2022. See the [CCFRP Index of Abundance](#ccfrp-index) appendix section for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection for these data. The estimated index of abundance was weighted based sample locations outside (reference) and inside MPAs (73 and 80 percent of areas open to fishing in the north and south, respectively, see [CDFW ROV](cdfw-rov-index) appendix for additional information about the development of rocky habitat estimates). Interpreted bathymetry classifying substrate as rock or sand is available at high resolution for state waters north of Point Conception, but is not complete for southern California (Figure \ref{ccfrp-map}). The estimated index of abundance was variable but generally flat between 2007-2016, increased in 2017 when sampling locations expanded across the northern coast with an increasing trend up until 2020, and slightly declined in the final two years in the dataset (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-index-main}). To account for the range expansion of this survey in areas with potentially larger `r spp` and/or areas with lower fishing pressure starting in 2017, a time block in selectivity was assumed in the model.  


#### Composition Data
\ 

Length measurements were available for 2007-2022 from the CCFRP survey `r area` and age data were collected between 2017-2022 (Table \ref{tab:ccfrp-samps}). The length data by designation, MPA and Reference, were weighted based on the estimated rocky habitat within each designation north of Point Conception (80 percent of areas open to fishing). The lengths observed by the survey ranged between 25-50 cm across the sample years with the mean length observed ranging between 33-40 cm (Figures \ref{fig:ccfrp-len-data} and \ref{fig:ccfrp-mean-len-data}). The survey collected age data from a subset of fish sampled between 2017-2022 (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-age-data}). The read ages from these sampled fish ranged between 2-33 years of age.

### California Department of Fish and Wildlife Remotely Operated Vehicle Survey

On May 18th, 2023, approximately four days before the document deadline, CDFW contacted the STAT to inform them that an issue had been identified with the data provided for the CDFW ROV survey. It was determined that the line identifications for transects were not completely unique as previously thought. A small subset of transects were identified to have disparate sampling sites combined into transects (i.e., data collected across separate transects were combined into incorrect transects). This issue was identified to have occurred in a total of 24 out of the 1810 transects conducted statewide across all years. As a results the data within select transects were modified and 12 additional transects were added to the dataset. All data and analysis presented for the CDFW ROV survey is representative of the original data. Comparisons between the indices of abundance based on the original and the corrected data is provided in the CDFW ROV survey Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index}.

#### Index of Abundance 
\

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE), have been conducting remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys along the California coast in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reference sites adjacent to them since 2004 for the purposes of long-term monitoring of changes in size, density (fish/square meter) and length of fish and invertebrate species along the California coast. Surveys of the entire coast have now been undertaken twice, each taking three years to complete, 2014-2016 and again in 2019-2021. The survey conducted multiple 500 meter transects across rocky reef survey sites. Sample sites were selected by first randomly selecting the deepest transect at a given site, then selecting transects on a constant interval into shallower depths. Transects were designed to be oriented parallel to general depth contours, though they were carried out using a fixed bearing that crossed depths in some cases.

The data were explored using a super year approach where the central years, 2015 and 2020, were designated as the super year and the data were split north and south of Point Conception. The effort of the survey was split roughly equally between sites that were within MPAs or areas open to fishing (referred to as "Reference") with sampling across most sites (termed "MPA group") within each super year. The number of transects and the number of `r spp` by site and super year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-obs} with the number of observations across all years by location shown in Figure \ref{fig:rov-obs-loc}.  The trend in the calculated catch-per-unit-effort based on the data alone was highly variable across sampling locations and by MPA or Reference area (Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).   

CDFW provided an initial analysis of the CDFW ROV survey data which helped in determination of which modeling approaches would be considered for these data. The final selected model assumed a negative binomial error structure with covariates for super year, site designation (MPA or Reference), and super year site designation interaction. The estimated index of abundance was weighted based on the proportion of hard substrate either in MPA (20 percent) or Reference (80 percent) areas in California `r area`. The weighted index of abundance increases between the two super years 2015 and 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:rov-index-main}). Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes, and model selection can be found in the Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index}.

#### Composition Data
\

CDFW provided annual fish length measurements made from images taken with stereo-cameras in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:rov-len}). The ROV was equipped with two locally recorded stereo cameras mounted in a fixed orientation in parallel with the primary forward-facing camera used for navigation, identification and enumeration. Paired stereo video cameras were calibrated to provide accurate feature measurements by MARE prior to in-field data collection. Fish length was determined based on a photogrammetric intersection to calculate 3D coordinates from measured image coordinates to measure fork length to the nearest millimeter. Processors selected two 3D points, fish head and tail, on both time-synced port and starboard stereo images. Processors made note of an generated precision value that was computed alongside each measurement. The software then computed the Euclidean distance between the two 3D points to give a length measurement. Sizes were rounded to the nearest centimeter. The precision of estimates was determined and represents the repeatability and geometric quality of a measurement, and is dependent upon the location of the individual in the camera view and the clarity of the point measured. Precision values greater than 10 mm were recorded in the database alongside measurements, as precision values less than 10 mm meant measurements were deemed fully repeatable. Fish observations from initial species scoring were marked “not sizable” if the nose/tail of the fish was cut off in either stereo view, the fish was missing in one view, or the orientation of the fish obscured measurement or produced an extreme precision measurement. Fish were marked “not visible” if the fish was not visible in either the port or starboard image. Fish marked “not sizable” and “not visible” were removed from the final data set submitted by CDFW.

Explorations around how to use the length data within the base model were conducted (super period, combined externally into two years, by year). These explorations indicated similar fit to these data across the alternative approaches and entering them by year was selected in order to understand the fit to these data relative to the model expectations by year. The length data were weighted by MPA/Reference area and were grouped by the collection year (Figures \ref{fig:rov-len-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rov-len-data}). The input sample size was set equal to the weighted number of unique transects `r area`.

### Growth Data {#growth-data}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age data, not associated with fishery fleets or surveys, were available for `r spp` and incorporated in the model to inform growth. These independent age data collection efforts were derived from four programs `r area` since 2001: 227 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 430 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 45 otoliths from CDFW special collections, and 77 otoliths collected by Jeff Abrams research program, and  (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these four sources were included in the model as a "growth" fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. These collections had a wide distribution of lengths and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).

### Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. Therefore, this design incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The observations of `r spp` by the `r wcgbt` are limited. The `r wcgbt` uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast and _a priori_ it would not be expected to be an informative data source for `r spp`, which are generally more closely associated with rock substrate. The `r wcgbt` had very limited positive tows by year that observed `r spp` within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance for `r spp` (Table \ref{tab:wcgbt-pos-tows}). The catch-per-unit-effort across all years for the NWFSC WCGBT survey is low across all years (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-cpue}). The observations of `r spp` by the NWFSC WCGBT survey commonly occur between 50 - 120 meters (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-depth}). The `r wcgbt` has regularly collected length and age samples from positive tows for `r spp` `r area` (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-len-age}). These data were used as conditional-age-at-length data to inform the estimation of growth within the model. See the [Length-at-Age](#length-at-age) section for data used to inform growth estimation.

The 50 percent size-at-maturity was estimated at `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1], 1)` cm with a slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}). This area-specific maturity-at-length estimate is relatively similar but with fish maturing at a slightly larger size compared to the biological maturity curve assumed for `r spp` south of Point Conception. Additionally, these values are both slightly smaller compared to estimates by Hannah [-@hannah_length_2014] for fish observed in Oregon waters. Hannah [-@hannah_length_2014]  estimated the size at 50 percent maturity of copper rockfish at 34.8 cm with a slope of -0.60.

### Growth (Length-at-Age) {#length-at-age}

Length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` informed by age data from the fisheries, the CCFRP survey, and independent age data collection efforts from four programs `r area` since 2002: 207 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 426 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 74 from a research survey conducted by Abrams, and 45 from CDFW special collections (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these sources were included in the model as a "growth" fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. 

Sex-specific growth parameters `r area` were initially estimated external to the model using the von Bertanlaffy growth curve as parameterized within Stock Synthesis at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{age=2}$ = 21.4 cm; $L_{age=20}$ = 47.3 cm; $k$ = 0.174 per year

Males $L_{age=2}$ = 20.3 cm; $L_{age=20}$ = 46.4 cm; $k$ = 0.201 per year

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.50cm}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female `r spp`.

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to 
estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the coast of California, north and south of Point Conception. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A 
series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Bridging Analysis

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2021 data-moderate assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21, which produced the same estimates for spawning output and relative spawning output across the time series (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). Additional bridging analyses were conducted examining the impact of revised model structure and updating existing data sources, and adding new data into the model. First, the fishery fleet structure was modified from the 2021 structure where the new assessment separated commercial data into two fleets based on fish landed condition, dead or live, and the recreational data into two fleets, CPFV and PR. The 2021 recreational and commercial data were reprocessed  into the new model structure through 2021 and new selectivity parameters were added to the 2021 for the newly split data. The new data available in for this assessment were then added to the model retaining the same model structure where feasible in the following order:

1. Update externally estimated biology parameters for length-at-age, weight-at-age, and maturity.
2. Add new catch data for all fishery fleets.
3. Add all updated commercial and recreational length and age data.
4. Add the new fishery-dependent indices of abundance.
5. Add the CDFW ROV survey index of abundance and length data.
6. Add the CCFRP Hook and Line survey index of abundance, length, and age data.
7. Add selectivity blocks for the commercial and recreational fleets.
8. Adjust the estimation of annual recruitment deviations.
9. Add conditional-age-at-length data for the growth fleet and estimate growth parameters for both sexes.

The data bridging results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-2}. Revising the model structure, and updating biology and removals resulted in small changes to the estimated spawning output and stock status (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-1}). Updating and adding the fishery lengths, ages, and indices resulted in a less depleted final population at the end of the time series. Adding and updating survey data, adding selectivity blocks, and estimating annual recruitment deviations and growth resulted in only minimal revisions in the population estimates (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-2}). Adjusting the annual recruitment deviations (years estimates and bias adjustment) resulted in a small decline in final spawning output and relative spawning output. The final bridging step that added the conditional-age-at-length data for the growth fleet and allowed the estimation of growth resulted in an increase in spawning output and relative spawning output at the end of the time series. 

To arrive at a final base model additional revisions to the model structure, selectivity blocks, and selectivity parameterization were done in order to determine the best fit to the data.


### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'32_model_structure_assumptions.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```


The northern California model is fit to two fishery-dependent indices of relative abundance: 1) CDFW CRFS onboard observer survey, and 2) CDFW CRFS private/rentals PR1 dockside survey. Additionally, a MRFSS CPFV dockside index was generated, but due to data concerns, was not included in the base model. The MRFSS CPFV dockside index is assumed to be proportional to changes in the relative abundance of the recreational party/charter fleet and represents retained fish only. The CDFW onboard observer index represents the same recreational party/charter fleet and includes both retained and discarded fish. The onboard index is specified as a separate “survey” fleet in the model because it overlaps in time with the MRFSS dockside time series. Both the MRFSS and onboard indices use the recreational party/charter fleet’s selectivity curve to define vulnerable size classes. The CRFS PR1 dockside index is linked to the recreational private/rental boat fleet, and had a selectivity curve differed from the party/charter fleet. 

Recreational length measurements are included as marginal length compositions (proportions at length, sexes combined) by year starting in 1959 for both the CPFV and PR modes. Fishery-dependent length composition data are also included for the commercial fleets starting in 1980 for the dead fishery and 1994 for the live fishery. There were limited historical age data available for `r spp`. Age data available from the CPFV fleet in 1978, 1981, and 1984 were included as marginal ages in the base model. In recent years, age data was available from the commercial dead, CPFV, and PR fleets and were input as conditional-age-at-length data, except for a subset of ages based on filleted length from the CPFV fleet in 2022 which were used as marginal ages.

The indices were assumed to have a lognormal distribution standard error structure.

Recreational length measurements are included as marginal length compositions (proportions at length, sexes combined) by year starting in 1959 for both the CPFV and PR modes. Fishery-dependent length composition data are also included for the commercial fleets starting in 1980 for the dead fishery and 1994 for the commercial live fleet. There were limited historical age data available for `r spp`. Age data available from the CPFV fleet in 1978, 1981, and 1984 were included as marginal ages in the base model. In recent years, age data was available from the commercial dead, CPFV, and PR fleets and were input as conditional-age-at-length data, except for a subset of ages based on filleted length from the CPFV fleet in 2022 which were used as marginal ages. All composition data were fit with a multinomial error structure.


Fishery-independent data sources in the southern California model are organized into two fleets: 1) CDFW ROV survey and 2) CCFRP Hook and Line survey. Each of the survey data sources were used to create an index of relative abundance and included marginal length compositions by sex and year. Age data from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey were included as conditional-age-at-length data by sex and year.   

Additional available age structures that could not be linked to one of the fleets above or represented a subset of information from a fleet were included in a growth fleet. The `r wcgbt` was not considered for an index of abundance, but is a source of conditional-age-at-length data and associated marginal length comps, both by sex and year. Additional age data collected by Adams and Pearson Research studies were inlcuded in the growth fleet. Selectivity by the growth fleet was age-based and estimated to have full selectivity starting at age-1.

Time blocks on selectivity were explored extensively when setting up the initial model structure. A range of management changes to the commercial fishery were considered when determining periods when selectivity may have been expected to change. Commercial removals for `r spp` are relatively low when compared to recreational removals for this species which limited the amount of composition data available to support estimation of changes in selectivity. Given this and the limited evidence in the available length data, time-invariant selectivity was selected for the commercial dead fleet. A single time block was assumed in the commercial live fleet due to a sharp decline in the mean size observed in this fleet starting in 2010. The STAT contacted various participants in the live fish fishery to determine what regulations and/or market changes may have created this shift in targeting but no clear cause was identified.  


The same time block structure was assumed for both the recreational CPFV and PR fleets based on gear restrictions and depth closures. Selectivity was blocked into three periods: 1916-2001, 2002-2016, and 2017-2022. In 2022 the sub-bag limit in the California recreational fishery was reduced to only allow one `r spp`. However, the amount of length samples in 2022 were not informative about a change in selectivity. Finally, a time block in selectivity was applied to the CCFRP Hook and Line survey starting in 2017 when the survey extended their sampling across California. 

The same time block structure was assumed both the recreational CPFV and PR fleets based on gear restrictions and depth closures (Figure \ref{fig:depth-closures}). Selectivity blocked into three periods: 1916-2001, 2002-2016, and 2017-2022. In 2022 the sub-bag limit in the California recreational fishery was reduce to only allow one `r spp`. However, the amount of length samples in 2022 were not informative about a change in selectivity. Finally, a time block in selectivity was applied to the CCFRP Hook and Line survey starting in 2017 when the survey extended their sampling across California. 


The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that affects the estimate of early model uncertainty around stock scale and status. Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1970 - 2019 to appropriately quantify uncertainty in the early model years. The earliest length-composition data occur in 1959 and limited age-composition data available in between 1975-1984. However, age data were not collected on a yearly basis until 2002. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the early-1980s to 2018. The period from 1900 - 1969 was fit using an early recruitment deviation series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1970 - 2019 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and 2020 onward recruitment deviations were assumed to be 0 due to limited information at the end of the time-series. Methot [-@methot_adjusting_2011a] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation of recruitment variability was assumed to be 0.50 based on the estimated variation in recruitment from the base model. Annual recruitment deviations were not forced to be fully zero centered during the main recruitment period in order to allow the data to fully inform the estimation and to avoid this constraint altering the annual estimates. Early model explorations revealed that forcing annual deviations to be zero-centered, and the selected period of the main recruitment, impacted the annual estimates. Allowing annual recruitment deviations to not be fully zero-centered allowed the annual estimates to be informed by data rather than the model structure.

```


### Data Weighting

Length composition data for the commercial fishery started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in 
Sections \ref{commercial-fishery}. The input sample size for the length composition data from the recreational fisheries was determined based on the number of estimated trips (described in Sections \ref{recreational-fishery}), the CCFRP Hook and Line survey was set equal to the number of positive drops by year, and the CDFW ROV were set equal to the number of positive transects. The majority of age-composition data were input as conditional-age-at-length with input sample size equal to the number of ages. The age-composition data from the historical CPFV samples were used as marginal age-composition with the input sample size set equal to the number of ages.     

The base  model was weighted using the "Francis method", based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011], and selected based on model stability and consistency to identify the minimum likelihood estimate (MLE). This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution). Since Francis data weighting is determined by the mean and variance in observations across years, the age data from the PR fleet, which had only one year of composition data, were weighted based on recommended values from the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weight [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997].

Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in the model fits and results due to weighting using McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] and the Dirichlet Multinomial 
Weighting [@thorson_modelbased_2017].

### Model Parameters

There were 154 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 8 parameters for growth, 
5 parameters for extra variability for the fishery and survey indices, 20 parameters for length-based selectivity and time 
blocking of the fleets and the surveys, and 120 recruitment deviations including 16 pre-model estimates (Table \ref{tab:params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, the mean of the prior. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were performed for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr^-1^ for females and males, the median of the prior. Estimation of natural mortality was explored during model development. The estimate of natural mortality is uncertain and poorly informed by the data. When estimated, natural mortality was low (around 0.090 yr^-1^) relative to the median of the prior which was based on maximum age; however, well within the prior distribution (SE = 0.31). The observations of fish greater than 50 years of age is rare in this assessment area as well as across the West Coast, so a natural mortality that would be associated with a maximum around 60 years of age did not seem well supported. Natural mortality was fixed in the base model but estimation of this parameter for both sexes was explored via sensitivities. 

The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.50 ($\sigma_R$). Maturity-at-length was fixed as described above in Section \ref{maturation-and-fecundity}. A single California sex-specific length-weight relationship was fixed at externally derived estimates using the `r hkl` and `r wcgbt` length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:est-len-wght}). Finally, the length at age 2 for both sexes in the growth function was fixed based on the model estimates due to large uncertainty around these values (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}).

## Base Model Results

The base model described here is only for the portion of the `r spp` stock in California from Point Conception, \PtC to the California/Oregon border, \CAOR  Descriptions of the summed biomass and stock status for the California stock of `r spp` are described in later sections.  

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \@ref(tab:params) and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:north-likes}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:north-timeseries}. 

The full r4ss plotting output is available in the supplementary material on the [Pacific Fishery Management Council website](pcouncil.org).

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The log($R_0$) was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. 

The northern California base model estimated reasonable growth parameters for $k$ and lengths at age 2 and age 20 for males and females. The estimates differed from those estimated externally, which was not unexpected given the lack of consistent age data across fleets and years. The direct estimation of male $L_{age=2}$ = 12 cm was reasonable compared to female  $L_{age=2}$ = 14.6 cm.  While $k$ was estimated larger for males (0.20 yr^-1^) than females (0.15 yr^-1^), female $L_{age=20}$ of 48.3 cm was larger than males at 46.4 cm. These results are consistent with other studies that have looked at sex-specific growth in copper rockfish and similar to estimates from the southern California pre-STAR base model.

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets, and age-based selectivity of 1.0 starting at age 1 for the growth fleet. Model explorations included parameterizing the fleets with double normal selectivity. Selectivity of the commercial dead fleet and the CDFW ROV survey were consistently estimated as asymptotic through base model development and were simplified to two parameter logistic selectivity in the base model. Peak selectivity for the commercial dead fleet was estimated at 34 cm, and 32 cm for the ROV survey. Plots of the estimated selectivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:est-selex}. 

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets, and age-based selectivity of 1.0 starting at age 1 for the growth fleet. Model explorations included parameterizing the fleets with double normal selectivity. Selectivity of the commercial dead fleet and the CDFW ROV survey were continually estimated as asymptotic through base model development and were simplified to two parameter logistic selectivity in the base model. Peak selectivity for the commercial dead fleet was estimated at 34 cm and 32 cm for the CDFW ROV survey. Plots of the estimated selectivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:est-selex}. 


The commercial live fishery selectivity was estimated in two blocks of time; `r startyr` - 2010 and 2011 - `r endyr`. The block in selectivity was included to capture a shift from asymptotic selectivity prior to 2011 to the selection of plate-sized (approx. 2 pounds) fish preferred in the live-fish fishery (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-len-data}). Both recreational fleets were fit to the same three time blocks. From 1916-2001, peak selectivity was estimated around 36 cm with selectivity decreasing for larger fish; dome-shaped selectivity was estimated from  2002-2016 representing the years the fishery was restricted to shallower depths, and asymptotic selectivity starting in 2017 when the fishery gained access to deeper depths. The two estimated PR fleet selectivities were both dome-shaped with the wider peak selectivity estimated in 2017-2022 representing the change in depth regulations.

The CCFRP survey estimated peak selectivity at 33 cm in both time blocks with the first time block estimating decreased selectivity of larger fish. The survey expanded to northern California in 2017 where larger copper rockfish were observed and estimated asymptotic selectivity for fish larger than 33 cm.

The catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. The analytical values for catchability were small given the survey methodologies and are reported in Table \ref{tab:params} in log-space.  Additional fishery and survey index variability were added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the were estimated within the model. The model estimated the largest added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Rec_Private(4)", 3], 3)` for the recreational PR fishery index, the survey with the largest samples size. In contrast the model estimated only limited additional variability in order to fit the recreational CRFS CPFV fishery index (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CRFS_CPFV(8)", 3], 3)`). The model fit the trend in the CCFRP survey with added variance estimated to fit the time series of 
 `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CCFRP(5)", 3], 3)`, while the model added 
  `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Deb_CPFV(7))", 3], 3)` and still did not fit the trend in the index. The model fit the CDFW ROV survey index well and estimated a small added variance of  `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CDFW_ROV(6)", 3], 3)`.

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. The bias adjustment applied to the annual recruitment deviations across time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adjust}. Strong recruitment events are estimated to have occurred in 1966-1967, 2007 and 2017 with the years of lowest estimated recruitment being 1979 and 1980. The uncertainty in recruitment deviations is highest for the first two years, 1970 and 1971, and relatively consistent for the remainder of the time series. There is limited information in the data on recruitment variability from the available data.  During model explorations, the recruitment deviations were most sensitive to the removal of the available age and fishery index data.  

Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in 2021 and 2022  (Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}). The recruitment bias adjustment was applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adjust}.

### Fits to the Data

#### Fits to length and age composition

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Annual length composition fits are shown in the Appendix, Section \ref{detailed-fit-comps}.  Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}.  

The aggregated lengths for the commercial dead fleet reflected a wide selection across sizes, with the model under-predicting the selection for both small males and females. The majority of the length data for the commercial dead fleet consisted of unsexed fish with sex-specific lengths available from 1980, 1984, 1999, and 2019-2022. The aggregate length composition fit well with the asymptotic selectivity curve for the commercial dead fleet. Multiple sensitivities were conducted to explore alternative parameterization of commercial dead fleet selectivity. The Pearson residuals for the commercial dead fishery length data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-pearson}.  The commercial mean lengths of unsexed fish were generally stable between 1990 - 2019 and decreased to smaller sizes from 2019 - 2022, with high uncertainty in the mean lengths of unsexed fish in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-mean-len-fit}). The observations of larger fish, greater than 40 cm, are minimally greater than the model expectations after 2010. A limited number of ages from the commercial dead fleet were available from 2019-2022.  The model estimated mean conditional age was within the bounds of uncertainty, but was not well fit (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-mean-age}).

Starting in 2010, the commercial live fleet length data shifts to smaller fish with observations greater than model expectations for fish between 25 - 30 cm. All available lengths for the commercial live fleet were from unsexed fish and the aggregated length data were fit relatively well given the change in selectivity in 2011. There were no ages available from the commercial live fleet.  The Pearson residuals for the commercial live fishery length data area shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-live-pearson}.  The means of observed commercial lengths of unsexed fish were not stable prior to 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-mean-len-fit}). From 2011-2022 the mean lengths of fish in the live fishery are relatively stable, with a notable decrease in 2016.


The length compositions for the recreational CPFV fleet were relatively well fit throughout the time series, except for a few years where a number of fish in a single size class were observed that the model did not expect given the selectivity.  The Pearson residuals do not show an indication of any strong year classes from the available lengths (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-pearson}). The mean length of observed unsexed fish from the CPFV fleet was fit relatively well, indicating a slight increase in mean size around 2000, a decrease from 2007-2011 and a slight increase again from 2013-2018  (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-mean-len-fit}). The number of sexed fish available from the CPFV fleet is small. The last year of data was not well fit and was estimated with high uncertainty. Age data were only available from 2022 from a combination of NMFS SWFSC Cooperative Research Sampling collections and the CDFW groundfish group. A small fraction of these fish were unsexed, and the Pearson residuals indicate these data were generally well-fit  (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-age-pearson}).

The Pearson residuals for the recreational PR length data were variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, with observations greater than expected, for small fish prior to 1997 and were generally variable showing no clear misfit in the model in recent years. The aggregate length composition data from the PR fleet had a slightly higher peak around 29 cm with fewer observations.  The length composition across years is fit well from 2004-2022 when CDFW implemented the CRFS sampling program.  A wide range of sizes were observed from 1959-1987 with poorer fits in years with less data such as 1989 and 1996-2002. The mean length by year for the recreational PR fleet was highly variable across years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-mean-len-fit}). The implementation of the MPA network may have impacted the shift to smaller mean sizes in those years.  CDFW collected ages from the recreational PR fleet in 2022. The peak of the age distribution was underestimated by the model(Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-age-pearson}).


The aggregated length compositions for both fishery-independent surveys, CCFRP and the CDFW ROV, were fit reasonably well with an underestimation of fish at around 40-45 cm in the ROV survey. Both of these surveys were conducted in California state waters and represent samples from inside and outside the MPAs. The annual fits to the CCFRP length data were not as well fit as other data sources in any given year, but the observation of larger fish when the survey expanded north in 2017 is pronounced. The Pearson residuals are presented in Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-len-pearson} and exhibit no clear pattern. The model estimated mean length was increasing from 2014-2016 prior to the survey's expansion  (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-mean-len-fit}). The model did not fit the decrease in observed mean length in 2019, but did capture the increase in mean age in 2022. Age data were available from 2018, 2019 and 2022 from the CCFRP survey and were input as conditional age-at-length data. The data had a slightly higher proportion of older fish given  estimated growth  (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-age-pearson}). Of note is that all of these ages represent the time period after the survey expanded and selectivity was estimated to be asymptotic.

The length composition data for the ROV survey were available at a finer scale than the super years available for the index of abundance. Not surprisingly, the year with the most available length observations, 2021, had the best fit to the length data, although was an underestimate for fish in the 35-45  cm range. No trend was observed from the Pearson residuals (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-len-pearson}). The survey covered a wide range of depths and the same increasing trend in mean size as the CCFRP data was observed in the ROV survey from 2019-2021 (Figure \ref{fig:rov-mean-len-fit}).


#### Fits to Indices of Abundance
\

Fits to the indices vary in quality.  The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard survey from 1988-1998 indicated a decline from 1992-1998 that was not fit well by the model.  However, this is the highest quality data source for the time period and with the added variance, the model fit was fairly flat and uninformative (Figure \@ref(fig:dwv-cpfv-index-fit)). The index spans the years where the stock biomass begins to increase, creating a conflict between the index and the population trend. The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg survey effort was concentrated in central California, similar to the area surveyed from 2007-2016 in the CCFRP survey.  

The CDFW and Cal Poly onboard index was relatively flat from 2004-2015 and the increase in relative CPUE in the ending years, 2017-2019. These ending years represent the time period when the fishery had access to deeper water, but the increase in relative CPUE in 2016 was not due to changes in regulations (Figure \@ref(fig:crfs-cpfv-index-fit)). The model fit the ending years of data to the upper bound of the added variability.

The recreational dockside PR index showed a similar trend as the CPFV onboard index (Figure \@ref(fig:crfs-pr-index-fit)). The index was well fit during the first part of the time series when it was relatively flat (2004-2015), but the increase in relative CPUE in the ending years, 2017-2019, was not well captured by the model. Even with selectivity time blocks for these periods, the index was not fit in 2017. 

The CDFW ROV survey contained data grouped into two super years and the model estimated a relatively flat line with the added variance (Figure \ref{fig:rov-index-fit}). The CCFRP index reflects the same increase in relative CPUE in 2016 as the CPFV and PR indices, prior to the survey expansion and release of recreational depth restrictions. This index was weighted by the area within the MPAs, which exhibits an increasing trend compared to sites outside the survey at the end of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-index-fit)). The fit to the early part of the time series was reasonable given the available data.  Similar to the 2019 gopher/black-and-yellow rockfish complex CCFRP survey, the lowest estimated year in the CCFRP index was 2013, which was also not fit in the 2019 gopher stock assessment.  No explanation for the decrease in relative CPUE was identified. 


### Population Trajectory in the Modeled Area

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:north-timeseries} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The estimated spawning output decreases sharply in the late-1970s and continues to decline until reaching low levels in the late-1990s. The spawning output slowly increases between 2000 - 2010 with the rate of population growth increasing after 2011 as fish from recent years of above average recruitment begin to mature. The estimate of total biomass follows the same trend over time and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}. The estimated spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output for the sub-area `r area` reached a minimum of 0.17 in 1994 and then increased over the recent time period, with an ending year estimate of 0.52 in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}).

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and the catch distribution among fleets in the most recent year of the model, `r endyr`. Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ 
reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 0)` 
million eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is just below the target of 40% of unfished levels (Figure \@ref(fig:depl)). The relative fishing intensity, $(1-SPR)/(1-SPR_{50\%})$, was near the management target in 2020, and has fluctuated around the target level for the past decade (Figure \@ref(fig:1-spr) and \@ref(fig:phase)). 

Table \@ref(tab:north-reference) shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \@ref(fig:yield-north) shows the equilibrium yield curve and net production based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.

## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered using the jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using jitter input of 0.10. This was repeated 100 times with 89 out of 100 runs returning to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model, as presented, represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of specific changes to data inputs and model structural assumptions to further address uncertainty associated with the base model estimates and derived management quantities.  The majority of the sensitivity models are the result of a single change relative to the base model (i.e., they are not the result of cumulative changes such as the modeling approach used with the bridging analysis). Comparisons of likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from the sensitivity analysis are shown in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}-\ref{tab:sensitivities-3}. Comparison of all sensitivities relative to the base model are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-structure} and \ref{fig:sens-data}, with Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:sens-depl-3} showing the change in spawning output and the relative spawning output trajectories. Many additional sensitivity runs were explored during development and testing of the base model. This section focuses on the main data and structural sensitivity model runs and includes the following:

Structural Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item  Estimate natural mortality ($M$) for each sex.
  
  \item Estimate steepness ($h$).
  
  \item Estimate $M$ for each sex and $h$.
  
  \item Remove added variance from all fishery-dependent and -independent indices of abundance (fixed equal to 0.01).
  
  \item Fix recruitment to be equal to the stock-recruitment curve (no recruitment deviations).
  
  \item Apply Dirichlet data weights.
  
  \item Apply McAllister-Ianelli data weights.

\end{enumerate}

Data Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Fix the length-at-age 2 equal to the average of the sex-specific values, 13.6 cm.
  
  \item Fix the length-at-age 2 equal to the estimated values by sex from the model south of Point Conception.
   
  \item Reduce the CPFV and PR catch between 1970-1982 to half of each fleet's average catch for that period of time.
  
  \item Move the historical CPFV ages into the growth fleet.
  
  \item Enter the CDFW ROV length data as super periods.
  
  \item Retain only length data within the model (no indices or ages) and fix growth at the estimates.
  
  \item Remove the CPFV cooperative collection ages in 2022.
  
  \item Remove all age data and fix growth at the estimates.
  
  \item Remove the CCFRP Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the CDFW ROV survey data (index and lengths).
  
  \item Remove both the CCFRP Hook and Line and CDFW ROV survey data (indices, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the CRFS CPFV index of abundance.
  
  \item Remove the Deb-Wilson Vandenberg CPFV index of abundance.
  
  \item Remove the CRFS PR index of abundance.
  
\end{enumerate}


Across all the sensitivities conducted, only a subset resulted in distinct changes in the model estimates and the discussion here will focus on the sensitivities that were identified as resulting in the most significant changes. There are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-structure} and \ref{fig:sens-data}. For the sensitivity without recruitment deviations and predicting recruitment directly from the stock-recruitment curve, the estimate of initial unfished recruitment ($R_0$) increased and the contribution of the length contributed to the increased model likelihood (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}).  In addition, the model estimated a 63% increase in the 2023 spawning biomass.

The sensitivities estimating natural mortality and/or steepness all indicated a stock less productive than the base model, and resulted in a decreased 2023 spawning biomass. When only natural mortality was estimated, the NLL decreased by 10, female natural mortality was estimated at 0.066yr^-1^ and male natural mortality was estimated at 0.071yr^-1^. If only steepness was estimated, the model estimated is at 0.45 and the likelihood changed by 4 from the base model.  The model estimating both natural mortality and steepness balanced estimates between the models estimating the values based on the prior fixed values; $h$ = 0.64, female $M$ = 0.72 and male $M$ = 0.77.
In both sensitivities where natural mortality was estimated, the estimates were considered too low for a rockfish with a maximum age of less than 55. The model estimating only steepness also resulted in an estimate of less than half the prior (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}). The models estimating natural mortality and/or steepness are the only models that fit a flat, uninformative trend to Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's onboard data. The models with estimated natural mortality and/or steepness estimated a more depleted stock. 

The sensitivities removing each survey, one at a time, from the model provided insight into the contribution of each data stream to the base model.  While the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg index was not fit well by the model, the removal of the index results in the same directional increase in estimated 2023 spawning biomass as the removal of the more recent onboard observer CPFV survey (Figure \ref{fig:sens-data}).  

The sensitivity of the the reduced recreational catches from 1970-1982 address a question of uncertainty in the Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010]. Information on the minor nearshore rockfish species was more limited when the catch reconstruction was developed. and the estimates of catch during this time period in the north was estimated at twice that in southern California.  The sensitivity produced the expected shift to a smaller estimated stock size.  

There were few otolith available from young fish north of Point Conception to estimate the length at age 2. A sensitivity fixing length at age 2 to the mean of the estimates for the north did not result in a relative change to any of the parameters.  The southern model estimated the length at age 2 larger than the estimate for either sex in the north.  Fixing length at age 2 to the higher estimates from the southern increased the 2023 spawning biomass. The lower values for the northern model area reasonable.  The CAP lab observed the width of the first annuli from otoliths in California around 2mm (Patrick McDonald, pers. communication, CAP ageing lab) where as the first annuli is estimated around 1.1-1.3 mm from fish around 1.5 years of age captured near Prince William Sound and Sitka, Alaska (Kevin McNeel, pers. communication, Alaska Department of Fish and Game).  This is a possible indicator of the change in growth associated with latitude during the juvenile years.

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by successively removing years of data ranging from 2017 - 2021 (i.e., "Data -1 Years" corresponds to data through 2021). The estimated spawning output for all retrospectives was lower at the start of the time series and lower for the final model years (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}). The retrospective model through 2020 was very similar to the base model. Removing all five years of data produces a more similar estimate in spawning biomass than removing three years of data, suggesting data in the most recent three years provide information.  The recent years of positive recruitment deviations were largest in the base model. The estimates of relative spawning output to unfished were similar between the base model and the model with data through 2017, with intermediate peels of the data estimating a more depleted stock  (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}). The estimated relative spawning output to unfished in the retrospectives were within the bounds of uncertainty in the base model.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and sex-specific natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value. The priors for all parameters, including the parameter being profiled, were included in every likelihood model. For example, including the prior on natural mortality across the profiled values of natural mortality provides information on the likelihood contribution of that prior as if it were estimated in the model.  

The negative-log-likelihood was minimized at a log($R_0$)value of `r round(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters[rownames(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters) == "SR_LN(R0)", "Value"], 2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The likelihood profile was most informed by the recruitment and length components of the  likelihood. The length composition supported lower values of $R_0$ and the age composition supported larger values of $R_0$ across the values profiled. Across the values of log($R_0$) profiled, the range of end year spawning output was larger than the estimates of unfished biomass (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb}).  Ending year depletion ranged from 37-107 percent of unfished biomass (Figure \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 


The majority of data types did not provide  consistent information on the estimate of steepness given the data included in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). As with the profile over $R_0$, the contribution of recruitment to the likelihood was the most informative for steepness. The two recreational length composition components of the likelihood support a higher estimate of steepness than the the minimum identified by the profile (approx. 0.45). The estimated value was much lower than the fixed value in the base model (0.72).  The model responded as expected to the values over which steepness was profiled, with high values of $h$ resulting in both a higher ending spawning output and a less depleted stock (Figures \ref{fig:h-ssb} and \ref{fig:h-depl}). The ending year depletion ranged from 10-71 percent, a smaller range than the profile over $R_0$.  

The profile over female natural mortality suggested the negative log-likelihood was minimized at around 0.095 yr^-1^, which was much lower than the fixed value of 0.108 yr^-1^ in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The change in the likelihood when natural mortality was a little over 10. The length component of the likelihood provided the most influential information in estimation of natural mortality. Within the length likelihood component, the recreational CPFV length supported the lower value of natural mortality whereas the length data from CCFRP and both commercial fleets supported higher values of natural mortality.  The profile over female natural mortality had an overall smaller impact on the end year spawning biomass (Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb}).  However, the end year estimates of depletion ranged from 24-67 percent (Figure \ref{fig:m-depl}).  This range is outside the 95% asymptotic interval from the base model on the lower end, but is within the bounds for the higher values of natural mortality in the profile. 

### Historical Analysis

The estimated spawning output from both the 2013 and 2021 assessments for the portion of `r spp` `r area` compared to the base model are shown in Figures \ref{fig:comp-assess-sb} and \ref{fig:comp-assess-depl}. The model structure and the approach used in the 2013, index-based data-moderate assessment using Extended-Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis, was significantly different from both the 2021 and this assessment. While the estimates from the 2013 model were converted to spawning output for this comparison, the assumed growth, maturity, and selectivity in that assessment resulted in a significantly larger estimate of spawning output with a less depleted population. The estimated scale of the population and relative fraction of spawning output among the 2021 assessment and this base model were consistent despite the number of additional data sources, changes in biology (estimated vs. fixed at external estimates), and recruitment dynamics (estimation of annual recruitment deviations in the base model which fixed to 0 in the 2021 assessment).   

The majority of data types did not provide  consistent or information on the estimate of steepness given the data included in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). As with the profile over $R_0$, the contribution of recruitment to the likelihood was the most informative for steepness. The two recreational length composition components of the likelihood support a higher estimate of steepness than the the minimum identified by the profile (approx. 0.45). The estimated value was much lower than the fixed value in the base model (0.72). The  The model responded as expected to the values over which steepness was profiled, with high values of $h$ resulting in both a higher ending spawning out and a less depleted stock (Figures \ref{fig:h-ssb} and \ref{fig:h-depl}). The range of ending year depletion ranged from 10-71 percent, a smaller range than the profile over $R_0$.  

The profile over female natural mortality suggested the negative log-likelihood was minimized data around 0.095 yr^-1^, which was lower than the fixed value of 0.108 yr^-1^ in the base model (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}), and the change in likelihood was less than two.  The length component of the likelihood provided the most influential information in estimation of natural mortality. Within the length likelihood component, the recreational CPFV length supported the lower value of natural mortality whereas the length data from CCFRP and both commercial fleets supported higher values of natural mortality.  The profile over female natural mortality had an overall smaller impact on the end year spawning biomass (Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb}).  However, the end year estimates of depletion ranged from 24-67 percent (Figure \ref{fig:m-depl}).  This range is outside the 95% asymptotic interval from the base model on the lower end, but but within the bounds for the higher values of natural mortality in the profile.

A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).

Trips recorded with a primary area fished in Mexico or in bays, e.g., 
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
For indices representing only north of Point Conception, the years 1993-1994 were 
excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@stephens_multispecies_2004] filtering approach was used to predict the 
probability of catching copper rockfish, based 
on the species composition of the sampler examined catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative 
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage 
(present in at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model.  The remaining 
 xx species all co-occurred with copper rockfish in at least one trip 
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients 
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species that are more likely to co-occur with copper rockfish, 
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with copper rockfish 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sm-mrfss)).
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with copper rockfish include
copper, greenspotted, bocaccio, and olive rockfishes and ocean whitefish, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp 
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were 
kelp bass, Pacific bonito, white croaker, California sheephead, and barred sandbass.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species 
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of 
more than one species or species complex ("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall [-@stephens_multispecies_2004] proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index 
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives 
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch 
a copper rockfish based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False 
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a copper rockfish, given the 
catch composition, but caught at least one. The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives" of 0.31. The 
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method 
including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability of 
encountering copper rockfish. 
This assumes that if copper rockfish were caught, the anglers must have fished in 
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is 
"sampler-examined" and the samplers are well trained in species identification.


The threshold probability that balances FP and FN excludes 
5383 trips that did not catch a copper rockfish (84% 
of the trips), and 308 trips (5% of the data) that 
caught a copper rockfish. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that 
catching a copper rockfish indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing 
effort occurred in habitat where copper rockfish occur. Only “true negatives” 
(the 5383 
trips that neither caught copper rockfish, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) 
were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 
1043 trips, 70% 
of which encountered copper rockfish.  Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-mrfss) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-mrfss).


Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be 
ill-fitting. The proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial 
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that 
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch 
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) with a Bayesian delta-GLM model. 
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore <3 nm, offshore >3 nm) 
factors were evaluated. For assessments north of Point Conception, two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte 
to Santa Cruz ("N") and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo ("C"). For assessment models south 
of Point Conception, the region represents individual counties. Note that Santa Barbara 
county spans north and south of Point Conception, but all accessible fishing ports in Santa Barbara county are south of Point Conception and vessels rarely (if ever) transit Point Conception.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss)). 


The positive observations were modeled with a Lognormal distribution 
that was selected over a Gamma model
by a $\Delta AIC$ of 51.8, and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss)).  The delta-GLM
method allows selection of differing linear predictors between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits,

## Development of Indices of Abundance

### California Onboard CPFV Index of Abundance {#onboard-cpfv-index}

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'21f_crfs_cpfv_index.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```


In the assessment model, the recreational CPFV fleet is modeled as retained plus 
discarded fish. The proportion of observed discarded copper rockfish is small, 
averaging 3.5% over the time series (\@ref(tab:onboard-keepdiscard)) and are included in the index.

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that Cal Poly
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained 
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level.  
Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. 
The data went through a QA/QC process at the SWFSC which included mapping 
fishing drifts in ArcPro to determine if the recorded latitude and longitude were correct.  

We applied a number of data filters to the available data presented in Table 
\@ref(tab:onboard-filter). The onboard CPFV index restricts the time series to 2004-2019. 
The onboard observer survey 
began in 1999, but the sample sizes were small during the first years of the program. The 
years 1999-2003 also represent years where a number of regulations changed including gear limits, 
bag limits, and spatial closures.  Due to COVID-19, no onboard sampling took place in 2020. 
In 2021 the onboard sampling 
resumed in August, but not at full capacity. The southern California CPFV began an organized effort to avoid copper 
rockfish and encourage their clientele to release and descend copper rockfish 
when encountered. The northern California fleet also participated in this effort to an extent. 
In 2022, the CDFW implemented the one copper rockfish sub-bag 
limit and combined with avoidance by the fleet, the data for this year do not represent the available 
copper rockfish biomass. See the online supplementary material
or the history of regulation changes section for details.

The filters also included removal of the number of observed anglers and time fished at the tail 
ends of the distributions and removal of drifts occurring in depths outside copper rockfish's range 
(Table \@ref(tab:onboard-filter) and Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-depths)). 
We retained 17,458 drifts for index
 standardization, and 3,303 of those drifts encountered copper rockfish 
Table \@ref(tab:onboard-percentpos). 

We modeled catch per angler minutes fished (CPUE) by fishing drift. 
Prior to any modeling, the SWFSC QA/QC'd the data to ensure the location information was correct. 
Each drift was overlaid with the available interpreted substrate layer that characterizes 
rocky and hard substrate, assigned to a rocky reef, and the distance of the 
drift start location to rocky reef was calculated.  In addition, the depth of the start location was 
interpreted from the 2 m resolution bathymetry as well as 90 m resolution bathymetry 
layer for comparison. For drifts missing depth location, we assigned depth based on the 
best available depth based on the bathymetry.

To appropriately weight the onboard observer survey index by the available 
rocky substrate within a region, each drift was assigned to the closest area 
of rocky habitat. Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
along the mainland coast of southern California. These data 
were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters, but did not extend into state waters 
past the mainland coast. Additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as 
rock or soft bottom were compiled by analysts at the University of California Santa Cruz and are now
also available from CDFW's website. We used the available interpreted rocky substrate data to expand the 
known area of rocky substrate to areas in southern California that lack substrate type. This 
expansion of the estimated rocky substrate assumes that the proportions of rocky substrate within 
and outside state waters are similar.  Copper rockfish are a nearshore species and the majority of 
observed encounters were within state waters (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-waterarea)).
This is, of course, an estimation of the amount of rocky substrate, and represents the best available data. 
The calculations can be found in the online supplementary material. Starting in 2017, 
depth restrictions eased in districts 
north of Point Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths 
(Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-depths)). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are 
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigned to the larger 
areas considered as a factor in the index.


The covariates explored for model selection included year and four categorical region levels (CRFS Districts 3-6), a categorical variable for month, and continuous depth and depth-squared.  
Trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-regioncpue)). A year and region interaction 
was included after visualizing the trends in average CPUE over time, but was not significant 
(Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-average_cpue_by_region)). The full model was selected by AICc and 
included year, depth, depth squared and region
(Table \@ref(tab:onboard-model_selection)). 

Indices were fit via MLE from the sdmTMB package in R. The Q-Q plot for the negative binoimal 
model indicated a poor fit to the data, which as not surprising given the low percent of 
observed drifts encountering copper rockfish. A delta-Lognormal 
was selected over a delta-gamma by a delta AIC of 487.  The Q-Q plot indicated a much 
improved fit compared to the negative binomial model (Table \@ref(fig:onboard-qq)).
The relative abundance is predominantly flat during the time series, with a visible increase 
in CPUE in 2017 when deeper waters opened in portions of northern California after a 17 year closure (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-index) 
and Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-index)).

### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Onboard CPFV Index of Abundance {#dwv-cpfv-index}

The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data set is derived from an onboard observer survey conducted 
by CDFW in California north of Point Conception from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, @reilly_onboard_1998. During an 
observer trip the sampler rode along on the CPFV and recorded location-specific 
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers 
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 
people and the observed anglers change during each fishing stop. The catch cannot be 
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler 
also recorded the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting 
and ending depth, and measured retained and discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices 
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.


A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and develop a relational database @monk_documentation_2016. 
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop  were recorded at a finer 
scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location 
information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch 
information. Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers 
was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the 
vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number 
of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing 
stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for 
details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore 
excluded from the analysis (Table \@ref(tab:deb-filter)). Sampling mainly
targeted areas of central California.  Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of 
those launched from port in District 6, the most northern district in California.


Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps 
and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).
Reefs were aggregated to four regions to produce adequate sample sizes; 
the California/Oregon border to San Francisco (V1), San Francisco to Moss Landing (V2), 
Moss Landing to Big Sur (V3), and San Luis Obispo county to Point Conception (V4).  The ports in San 
Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic 
mean of CPUE by year was also higher in this area (Figure \@ref(fig:deb-regioncpue))


The filters also included removal of the number of observed anglers and time fished at the tail 
ends of the distributions and removal of drifts occurring in depths outside copper rockfish's range 
(Table \@ref(tab:deb-filter) and Figure \@ref(fig:deb-depths)). 
We retained 5,546 drifts for index standardization, with 
1,389 fishing locations encountering copper rockfish.  
Tables of the number of samples and positive observations can be found in Table \@ref(tab:deb-percentpos).


We modeled catch per angler hour fished (CPUE) by fishing stop where the angler 
hours were summed across drifts at a fishing stop. To explore weighting of the onboard observer survey index by the available 
rocky substrate within a region, each drift was assigned to the closest area 
of rocky habitat. Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
along the mainland coast of southern California. These data 
were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters, but did not extend into state waters 
past the mainland coast. Additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as 
rock or soft bottom were compiled by analysts at the University of California Santa Cruz and are now
also available from CDFW's website. We used the available interpreted rocky substrate data to expand the 
known area of rocky substrate to areas in southern California that lack substrate type. This 
expansion of the estimated rocky substrate assumes that the proportions of rocky substrate within 
and outside state waters are similar.


The covariates explored for model selection included year, four categorical region levels, and continuous depth and depth-squared.  
Trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:deb-regioncpue)). A year and region interaction 
was included after visualizing the trends in average CPUE over time, but was not significant 
(Figure \@ref(fig:deb-average_cpue_by_region)). The full model was selected by AICc and 
included year, depth, depth squared and region
(Table \@ref(tab:deb-model_selection)). 

Indices were fit via MLE from the sdmTMB package in R. The Q-Q plot for the negative binoimal 
model indicated a poor fit to the data, which as not surprising given the low percent of 
observed drifts encountering copper rockfish. A delta-gamma
was selected over a delta-lognormal by a delta AIC of 43.  The Q-Q plot indicated a much 
improved fit compared to the negative binomial model (Table \@ref(fig:onboard-qq)).
The relative abundance indicates a decreasing trend during the time series (Table \@ref(tab:deb-index) 
and Figure \@ref(fig:deb-index)).

### CRFS PR Dockside Index of Abundance {#crfs-pr-index}

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2022, 
were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The PR dockside data housed 
on the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN) were 
determined to include a number of complexities that precluded the ability to 
use them for an index of abundance. For the time period from 2004-2014 the authors 
re-created the interview, or trip level, data from the "i" sample files.  For 2015-2022 
the authors used files provided by CDFW from the CRFS dockside sampling program.

The data for both time periods included catch by species, number of anglers contributing to the catch, angler-reported area of fishing, 
gear, county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The catch included 
the number of fish observed by the CRFS sample, the number of unobserved retained fish reported 
by the angler, and the number of discarded and descended fish reported by the angler.
The sample size of the 
unfiltered private boat data is much larger than the CPFV onboard observer data set, 
with 256,738 samples statewide from 2004-2022, 169,912 north 
of Point Conception and 86,826 south of Point Conception. 

Records were limited to the primary private and rental boats public-access sites, 
PR1 sites, which encompasses over 90% of the total private boat effort 
(Table \@ref(tab:pr-filter)). The CRFS interviews contain a small fraction 
(407 trips over the entire time series) of samples where the retained catch for 
rockfish is over the daily bag limit of 10 
fish per person. We did not remove these data from the index, but did 
only include sampler examined catch.  Rockfish species can be difficult to distinguish and there 
have not been any verification studies conducted to determine the uncertainty in angler reported 
unobserved catch.
Additional data filters included the exclusion of any samples from January and 
March, since those months have been closed to the recreational fishery north of Point 
Conception since 2005.  The time series was also restricted to 2004-2019.  Sampling during the 
COVID period (2020-2021) resulted in a higher fraction of the sampler examined catch in the 
"rockfish, general" category due to the social distancing requirements (Table \@ref(tab:pr-rfgen)). The CDFW 
implemented a one fish sub-bag limit for copper rockfish in 2022 and the quantiles and distribution of CPUE suggest that this 
regulation change impacted fishing behavior in the private boat fleet (Table \@ref(tab:pr-cpue) and 
Figure \@ref(fig:pr-bag)).

The angler reported water area was restricted to ocean areas in U.S. waters 
and a reported primary gear 
of hook-and-line or troll gear.  A number of trips reporting troll as the primary gear reported
a secondary gear of hook-and-line. To determine if the angler(s) interviewed targeted rockfish and
fished in rocky habitat, we retained trips if the angler reported the primary target species 
as rockfish or bottomfish or if rockfish was reported as the secondary target species. This filter 
replaced the Stephens-MacCall [@stephens_multispecies_2004] filtering approach. We retained 75,307 angler 
interviews for index standardization, with 15,549 including sampled examined copper rockfish (Table \@ref(tab:pr-filter)).  

We modeled retained catch per angler days with a negative binomial GLM in the R package sdmTMB. The initial model exploration included 
a delta-lognormal model that did not converge and a delta-gamma model, which did converge.  However, the proportion of zeroes was 
reproduced when the model was fit with a Bayesian negative binomial GLM (Figure \@ref(fig:pr-prop-zero)) and was retained despite the 
tail on the Q-Q plot of the MLE fit (Figure \@ref(fig:pr-qq)).  There are a handful of samples 
with higher than average CPUE and the authors checked with CDFW to determine whether the samples should still be included. 
CDFW indicated data sheets were not available prior to 2012, but the catches were less than 
the bag limits, and should be assumed to be correct. The significant year and region interaction was included in the final 
model selection and the index was area weighted based on the amount of interpreted rocky substrate in each district.  The ports along the northern 
California port are such that there is little overlap in the fishing grounds between ports, with the exception being the San Francisco Bay area. 
However, the private/rental fleet has a shorter range than the CPFV fleet and how we aggregated the data for the area weighting is appropriate (Figure \@ref(fig:pr-districtcpue)). 

Based on AICc values from maximum likelihood fits Table \@ref(tab:pr-modelselect), 
a main effects model including year, district and a year and district interaction. 
Month and primary target species were modeled as categorical covariates 
 (Table \@ref(tab:pr-index) and Figure \@ref(fig:pr-index)).

### CCFRP Index of Abundance {#ccfrp-index}

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, [CCFRP](https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/), 
is a fishery-independent 
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling 
locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs 
[@starr_variation_2015a; @wendt_collaborative_2009].  The CCFRP survey began in 
2007 along the central coast of California and was designed in collaboration 
with academics, NMFS scientists and fishermen. 
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast,
and has monitored four MPAs consistently. In 2017, the CCFRP expanded coastwide within California.  
The index of abundance was developed from the four MPAs sampled consistently 
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo and Point Lobos 
by Moss Landing Marine Labs; Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by Cal Poly).

The survey design for CCFRP consists 500 x 500 m cells both within and 
adjacent to each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly 
selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells).  CPFVs are chartered 
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for 
a fishing location.  During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 
30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, 
and released (or descended to depth) and can later be linked back to a particular angler, . 
 CCFRP samples shallower depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality.  
 Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin 
clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the 
index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the 
fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little 
filtering was needed for the index. 
Cells not consistently sampled over time were excluded as well as cells that never 
encountered `r spp`.
The full dataset for northern California contained 8,770 drifts, 23% of which encountered 
`r spp`.  After applying filters to remove drifts from sites that were not consistently sampled,
marked for exclusion in the data, or did not fish a minimum of 15 minutes, 7,078 drifts remained for 
for index standardization, with 1,757 drifts encountering `r spp`.

The CCFRP index includes all of the MPAs currently sampled from 2017-2022 and the core central California sampling sites from 2007-2022. Trends inside all of the MPAs sampled increased from 2017-2020. The final index (Table \@ref(tab:ccfrp-index)) represents a similar trend to the arithmetic mean of the annual CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-avg-cpue)). We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) using MLE in the sdmTMB package. Indices with a year and area (location along the coast) interaction were not considered in model selection due to the expansion of the survey in 2007, but a year and MPA interaction was modeled. Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-avg-cpue) mean by inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs over  time and illustrates the distinct trends of increasing average CPUE over time.

A negative binomial model was fit to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for angler 
hours). Because the average observed CPUE inside MPAs and in the reference sites exhibited 
differing trends, we explored a year:mpa/reference site interaction, which was selected as the best 
fit model by AIC Table \@ref(tab:ccfrp-model-selection)), The final model included
year, mpa/reference categorization, depth, depth squared, and a year:mpa/reference interaction. 
The model was fit using the sdmTMB R package (version 0.3.0). 

Based on work completed at the SWFSC, we estimate that the percent of rocky reef habitat from Point Conception to the California/Oregon border within California state waters is 892 $km^2$, of which approximately 23% is in MPAs that prohibit the harvest of groundfish (pers comm. Rebecca Miller, UCSC). There is recreational fishing outside of state waters, but habitat maps are not available at the same 2-m resolution and do not allow for direct comparisons. The final index was weighted, giving 20% of the model weight to MPAs and 80% of model 
weight to the "open" areas within the state.

### CDFW ROV Index of Abundance {#cdfw-rov-index}


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'10_appendix_rov.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

Minimal filtering was done to the data. Transects were removed based on four factors: 1) extreme estimates of effort (the estimated area of view below the ROV termed usable area), 2) any locations that were not sampled by both super year periods, 3) transects that crossed from MPA into reference areas, and 4) transects conducted across depths that never observed `r spp` within the survey (Table \ref{tab:rov-filtered}). Once the data were filtered the average calculated CPUE for each MPA and Reference group were plotted to visualize the data (Table \ref{tab:rov-obs} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).

A range of alternative model structures were explored to generate an index of abundances including alternative error structures, covariates, and factors. Based on model selection a model with super year, site designation (MPA or Reference), and super year site designation interaction was selected (Table \ref{tab:rov-model-selection}). A negative-binomial model was selected based on the distribution of the data and diagnostics (Figures \ref{fig:rov-qq}, \ref{fig:rov-resid}, and \ref{fig:rov-prop-zero}) using sdmTMB [@anderson_sdmtmb_2022]. The model estimates were then area-weighted based on the estimated percent of habitat within MPAs based on habitat seafloor mapping data within state waters, which for the region north of Point Conception were estimated to be 20 percent of rocky habitat within MPAs and 80 percent open to fishing. The weighted relative index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-index} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-index}.

On May 18th, 2023, approximately four days before the document deadline, CDFW contacted the STAT to inform them that an issue had been identified with the data provided for the CDFW ROV survey. It was determined that the line identifications for transects were not completely unique as previously thought. A small subset of transects were identified to have disparate sampling sites combined into transects (i.e., data collected across separate transects were combined into incorrect transects). This issue was identified to have occurred in a total of 24 out of the 1810 transects conducted statewide across all years. As a results the data within select transects were modified and 12 additional transects were added to the dataset. All data and analysis presented for the CDFW ROV survey is representative of the original data. Comparisons between the indices of abundance based on the original and the corrected data is shown in Figures \ref{fig:rov-corrected-index} and \ref{fig:rov-corrected-index-stand}.

## CPFV Fleet Description, Trip Types, and Sampling  {#cpfv-samples}

During the 2021 copper rockfish stock assessment review meeting and during the pre-assessment workshop for the 2023 groundfish assessments, concern was raised regarding possible biases in the available data from the CPFV fleet. This appendix describes the CPFV fleet, including the differences between the fleet north and south of Point Conception and why sampling by trip type was raised as a concern in southern California.  The goal of this exploratory analysis was to compare the CPFV logbook data and the onboard observer sampled trips to describe the proportion of sampled trips by trip type and the distribution of copper rockfish catches across trip types. We then used CPFV data from the two most recent years pre-COVID (2018 and 2019) to illustrate how the distribution of sampling effort compares to the distribution of fishing effort and catches of copper rockfish. 


*CPFV Fleet Description:* The CPFV fleets north and south of Point Conception are fundamentally different in terms of the size of the vessels, available target species, and accessible areas and depths. The CPFVs north of Point Conception targeting groundfish do not typically target other species on the same trip, with the exception being a half-day groundfish trip mixed with a half-day of Dungeness crab pot fishing.  Overnight trips are extremely rare in northern California and weather is a more constraining factor as you move north along the coast. There are few Coast Guard inspected vessels north of Bodega Bay, California and the recreational fleet is dominated by smaller six-pack vessels with limited capacity.  

In southern California, the diversity of target species is higher and includes several state-managed gamefish, coastal pelagics, and highly migratory species. There are three distinct trip types in southern California. The shortest of these is a half-day trip where a CPFV will run two trips a day. The three-quarter to full-day trips are able to access fishing grounds further offshore, such as the Channel Islands. Overnight and multi-day access areas including remote destinations such as San Nicholas Island and may target a combination of species, i.e., trips targeting tunas, but also catching rockfish. A number of CPFVs in southern California also transit to fish in Mexican waters for rockfish. The diversity of trip types and variety target species within a CPFV trip in southern California pose a challenge for both sampling and managing the fisheries. If either catch rates or size compositions vary across trip, in the absence of representative sampling, stock assessments may not be able to accurately account for that variability resulting in the possibility that selectivity and the input catches may be biased.


*Available CPFV Catch and Effort Data:* The components of the CDFW sampling programs used in this analysis are the CRFS CPFV onboard observer survey, CRFS angler interviews, and the mandatory, self-reported CPFV logbooks. 

The CRFS program divides California into six districts, and these represent the finest spatial stratification of catch and effort estimates for stock assessments and management (Figure \@ref(fig:crfs-districts)). The [CRFS sampling manual](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=62348&inline) outlines the sampling methodologies for each survey component. The [California Fisheries Recreational Fisheries Survey Methods](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36136&inline) indicates the CPFV mode "sampling goal is to sample onboard at the historical sampling frequency of two to five percent of estimated CPFV trips of interest (e.g., trips targeting groundfish, inshore and coastal pelagic species) at each CPFV landing and to sample other CPFV trip types dockside." 

The CRFS data collected onboard are a key component to obtaining species-specific information from the CPFV fleet because the state of California allows the filleting of fish at sea. To accurately identify rockfish species and obtain measurements of whole fish, the majority of CPFV angler interviews occur onboard the vessel. 

The CPFV logbooks include information on the the general location fished, number of anglers, number of fish retained and discarded, use of descending devices, as examples. The CPFV fleet, in the absense of an onboard observer, is not required to speciate the catch and only one CDFW block number (i.e., location identifying grid system) is recorded per entry. For these reasons the CPFV logbook data are not often used to develop an index of abundance for groundfish species. However, the CPFV logbook data provide insight into the spatial distribution of fishing effort and changes in effort over time.
 

*Data Summaries from 2018-2019:* In order to maintain confidentiality, we aggregated data within each dataset across 2018 and 2019, and across districts four and six (i.e., no trips were observed onboard in CRFS District 5 during 2018-2019).

We filtered the CPFV logbook data to trips that recorded at least one rockfish and the CPFV onboard observer data to trips that encountered at least 1 percent groundfish species. Additional filters were applied to the CPFV logbook data such as removing trips that recorded the primary fishing location in Mexican waters (6 percent of all trips). We also removed a small fraction (less than 10 trips) recorded as multi-day trips, but that reported a fishing location along the mainland of southern California. 

The combined onboard observer sampling rate for 2018-2019 was 3 percent of all CPFV trips statewide in the filtered data. No trips were observed onboard in CRFS District 5 during 2018-2019. However, 1,051 CPFV logbooks were submitted from District 5 ports that recorded at least one rockfish. When we grouped the data by the modeled areas north and south of Point Conception, we found that  2 percent of all trips in northern California were sampled onboard. In southern California, 4 percent of single-day trips were observed and less than 1 percent of multi-day trips were observed.

We then explored the southern California data further to look at sampling effort by trip type. The CPFV logbooks indicated if a trip was a single- or multi-day, but the logbooks do not differentiate between a half-day or three-quarter day trip. We assigned each CPFV logbook trip from southern California to a sub-region (District 1 mainland, District 2 mainland, northern Channel Islands, Southern Channel Islands, and Offshore) based upon the recorded block number (Table \@ref(tab:logbook-triptype)). The trips assigned to "Southern CA Offshore" were a catch-all that included blocks outside the range of a half-day trip, but not within the vicinity of an island. We separated out the "Southern CA Offshore" trips because it is likely their target species was not rockfish. Approximately 16 percent of the CPFV logbooks in southern California were from multi-day trips. As expected, the trips recording a CDFW block near the mainland were recorded as half-day trips. More than twice as many trips to the northern Channel Islands were single-day trips versus multi-day trips. The vessels in District 2 typically offer fewer half-day day trips and fish the nearshore when weather precludes crossing the channel to the northern Channel Islands on a three-quarter day trip. 


To put these sampling rates in context for copper rockfish, we looked at the total estimated mortality by district related to the distribution of sampling. The total mortality of copper rockfish in metric tons from 2018-2019 from the CPFV fleet by CRFS District is shown in Table \@ref(tab:catch-example). Fifty-two percent of the total copper rockfish mortality was from northern California and 48 percent from southern California.  Within northern California, 50 percent of the total mortality originated from District 3, and in southern California, 81 percent of the total mortality originated from District 2. 

From the onboard observer trips in District 1, 37 percent of the observed copper rockfish were from half-day day trips, 42 percent from three-quarter to full-day trips, and 21 percent of the observed copper rockfish were from the five observed multi-day trips (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-coppers)). 

In District 2, 17 percent of the observed copper rockfish were from half-day day trips, 75 percent from the three-quarter to full day trips, and 8 percent from multi-day trips. When weather allows, the northern Channel Islands can be accessed from CRFS District 2 during a three-quarter to full-day trip or a multi-day trip, depending on the port. For instance, the CPFVs from Channel Islands Sportfishing in Oxnard, California access the northern Channel Islands during multi-day trips, and the same areas are accessed by the three-quarter to full-day trips out of Santa Barbara Landing. 

The majority of length samples for the CPFV fleet are taken onboard the observed trips. The shift in the distribution of lengths from each trip type is evident from the overnight trips from District 1 with larger fish encountered on the overnight trips (Figure \ref{fig:copper-lengths}.  The average length of fish encountered on half-day trips out of District 2 is 33.1 cm compared to 36.3 for three-quarter day trips and 36.6 for overnight trips.  

To account for the differences in the the differences in catch rates and size compositions observed across trip types and areas, we would need to collect estimates of catch and effort at a finer-scale than the CRFS district. While the logbooks are not perfect, and there is a fraction of non-compliance, they highlight the intense fishing pressure in some areas and may help identify the how to distribute sampling efforts. For example, increased sampling in Districts 4-6 would also provide information on the length composition of the fish encountered by the CPFV fleet, especially considering the increase in average length with latitude (Figure \@ref(fig:copper-lengths)). The increased sampling in District 4-6 would also provide the data needed to create an accurate index of relative abundance from the onboard observer data, which can easily be considered one of the most valuable fishery-dependent data sources available. Based on additional data from the logbooks it may be possible to identify an approximate fraction of half-day to three-quarter day trips.
The lengths in Table \@ref(tab:copper-lengths) are currently all weighted equally in the length compositions within the current assessment models. Future research is needed to determine the effects of the changing size composition by trip type within stock assessment models, especially for southern California where larger fish are encountered on longer trips. Weighting the length composition data by the catch from each trip type is one possible method to account for the differences observed in Figure \@ref(fig:copper-lengths).

## Information Provided by the Commercial and Recreational Fleet Representatives


The copper rockfish STAT held the following three informal virtual meetings with stakeholders as part of the data exploration process:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Copper Rockfish and the Commercial Fisheries on January 10, 2023 (24 attendees)
  \item Copper Rockfish and the Recreational Fishery South of Point Conception on January 23, 2023 (17 attendees)
  \item Copper Rockfish and the Recreational Fishery North of Point Conception on January 30, 2023 (19 attendees)
  
\end{enumerate}


A summary of the information learned from these meetings is provided here. We would like to thank everyone who participated in our virtual meetings for their willingness to participate in the stock assessment process and provided additional insight into the fisheries for copper rockfish.

**Preferred Habitat and Life History Notes.** Copper rockfish are "king" of the reef and appear to push other species off of the best habitat within a reef. The STAT consistently heard from all fishermen that copper rockfish are not caught in areas of high relief. Copper rockfish prefer areas of flatter or broken hard bottom, and also venture out over soft bottom habitat. It is often larger fish caught over soft bottom where they are feeding on sanddabs. Copper rockfish do not feed on pyrosomes as frequently as other rockfish species.  Copper rockfish will follow prey targets, including pelagic red crabs that have been observed farther north than usual. In general rockfish catches decreased when prey (anchovies, squid, mychtophids, pyrosomes, etc.) are hyper abundant. Fishermen notice ontogenic shifts, as well as seasonal and weather related movements of copper rockfish. Copper also tend to move based on weather conditions. North of Point Conception (\PtC), copper rockfish cannot be found during bad weather and seem to move to deeper waters. This appears true of all rockfish in general with respect to long period swells that create heavy bottom surge, increased turbulence and suspend flocculent materials near the bottom. 


**Commercial Fishery.** To fish copper rockfish commercially in California a Deeper Nearshore permit is needed.  The trip limits of 75 pounds per two-month period in combination with depth restrictions have negatively impacted the commercial targeting of copper rockfish. The fleet reported releasing (by descending back to depth) more fish in 2022 with the current lower quota of 75 pounds per two-month period. Copper rockfish are a component of the live fish fishery in both northern and southern California. They are most often targeted to be sold live, but those fish that do not survive well are sold dead at a much lower price. 
Copper rockfish are encountered at an average depth of 45 fm, but can be found out to 60 fm. 

The live fish market is constantly in flux and can be difficult to predict. In southern California, a large portion of the live-fish fishery collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned. A fisherman's market in San Diego has allowed individual fishermen to sell fish directly to the public.Many of the live fish buyers in central California transport live fish to Las Vegas, Nevada or Los Angeles and San Jose in California. 

North of Point Conception, copper rockfish is a target of the commercial fleet. North of Cape Mendocino (\CapeM), live fish sell for 3-4 times the price of dead copper. For fishermen targeting black rockfish in the north, copper rockfish are an incidental catch of value.  Out of Morro Bay, coppers ranging between 1 and 6 pounds are most common in the 10-15 fm range and also sell for $7 to $8 per pound. In shallow waters, fishermen will use traps within the live-fish fleet and vertical gear for deeper waters. In Central California (near Morro Bay) the nearshore live-fish target species live in the kelp beds and larger coppers on the outside edges of the reef. Larger coppers are typically found on isolated outcrops. It's rare for the commercial live fleet to fish deeper than 15fa, and in central California it's harder to keep fish exhibiting barotrauma alive. The price of live fish is much higher.

Commercial fishermen from multiple areas along the coast emphasized that the price differential for copper by size is not as pronounced as it is for other species landed in the live-fish fishery. North of San Francisco, the commercial fleet encounters larger copper rockfish (~ 7 pounds) in general.  Fish smaller than 2.5 - 3 pounds (approximately 14-17 inches) are desired by the live-fish buyers and the restaurant market and thus will sell for a higher price. The larger fish can be retailed to the general public.

South of Point Conception, copper rockfish are not generally a target species for the live-fish fishery and have been difficult to market. The fleet is now marketing copper rockfish in Southern California as a species similar to the popular "grouper" (bocaccio rockfish, *S. paucispinis*) and demand is increasing. The majority of commercially caught copper rockfish in Southern California are sold dead.  The price of a dead copper in San Diego is around $6 per pound. The fleet can keep copper alive from depths as deep as 60 fathoms with no issue. Coppers seem to be the hardiest of the rockfish species. 


**Recreational Fishery.** In 1997 there were approximately 295 CPFVs in California and in 2022 that number was reduced to 193 active Coast Guard inspected CPFVs, vessels that can carry seven or more passengers. Of the 193 CPFVs in the state, 78 fish offshore exclusively. The number of active six-pack vessels is much less.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced loads were required on the CPFVs to maintain distancing among passengers. Customers preferred the reduced loads that resulted in a less crowded vessel and have been willing to pay the increased charter costs to maintain the reduced loads post-COVID. This is true along the entire coast of California for Coast Guard inspected vessels.

*North of Point Conception.* The majority of vessels north of Bodega Bay are six-packs. Vessels fishing out of Eureka generally fish closer to shore due to weather and fuel costs. The primary target in this area is salmon, and vessels will switch to rockfish especially if salmon are not biting or is salmon season is closed.

Larger copper rockfish can be found in 40-60 feet of water and swell is a good indicator for the presence of copper rockfish. If there is swell, the copper rockfish remain close to the bottom and are not as active, i.e., reduced chance of catching copper rockfish.  In Eureka, copper rockfish are a desirable species in the recreational fleet due to their larger average size. Copper rockfish would not be caught more than 5-10 feet off the bottom. 

In central California, small copper rockfish can be found in 100+ feet of water at the edge of the Farallon Islands. The last two to three weeks of December, fishermen out of Emeryville, California find aggregations of copper rockfish on shaled beds where they are not usually present.

Small copper rockfish have been caught off the the jetties in Humboldt, Pillar Point Harbor, and San Francisco, California. In the Half Moon Bay CFPV fleet, copper rockfish are rarely observed shallower than 35 fathoms and they tend to only bite the bottom hook. The gear regulations from unlimited hooks to two hooks per line and a one pole limit in 1999-2000 resulted in increased loss of fish to sea lions. 

*South of Point Conception.* After the depth restrictions and other closures the fleet moved to different fishing ground and the desire for copper rockfish increased retention. Over half of the habitat regularly fished by the 1/2-day vessels out of Mission Bay in San Diego is now within in protected areas closed to fishing, and the depth closures moved effort from offshore to inshore (<50-60fa) starting in 2001. During the summer months the effort of the fleet in southern California shifts to pelagic species and kelp and sand bass, the timing of which is dependent on ocean temperatures. There is more pressure on the rockfish stocks during cold water years.

The business of the recreational fleet is tied to the state of the economy. When fuel prices are high there are fewer boats fishing. Around 2014-2015, as the economy recovered, business started increasing.  Beginning in 2022, the CPFV fleet in southern California made a concerted effort to avoid copper rockfish grounds, and when copper rockfish were encountered, encouraged their clients to release and descend copper rockfish back to depth. Anglers who were not catching as many fish were more interested in retaining their copper rockfish.

In general, there is less rocky habitat in southern California compared to northern California. In southern California towards San Diego, coppers are typically found in less than 35 fathoms with juveniles in less than 10 fathoms. In some areas, size classes of coppers are mixed and are not caught deeper than 60 fathoms.

A portion of the U.S. fleet fishes rockfish in Mexican waters where there are some known areas of higher copper rockfish density. At the Coronado Islands in Mexico, coppers are typically found in 28-35 fathoms on low-relief habitat. Fishing is more consistent in Mexican waters.

The activity of private vessels is dependent on ocean conditions, the vessel's size, range and fuel costs. Private vessels of >25 feet are usually focused on pelagic species and may fish rockfish during the transit to or from HMS grounds.  It's difficult for the private anglers to access offshore waters at depths of 50+ fathoms.



**Additional Notes of Interest.** Some of the meeting attendees participate in Cooperative Research, such as the NWFSC and the CCFRP Hook and Line surveys and the SWFSC Cooperative Sampling Program.

During the NWFSC Hook and Line survey, there have been times when the vermilion and widow rockfishes are abundant and the lines are reeled in before even reaching the bottom where copper rockfish may be encountered. Anglers who previously participated in ROV studies with NMFS observed rockfish species moving to the bottom and hiding in crevices when the ground swell reached 6-7 ft. There is interest in participation in future ROV surveys.  

We heard interest from the CPFV fleet in deploying conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) devices during their trips. Fishermen are interested in tagging fish they release.

The number one question posed to the STAT at all meetings was, "How will the stock assessment account for closed areas?" The fleet would like to see some accounting for these areas in the assessment models.
