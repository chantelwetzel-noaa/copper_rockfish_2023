Two fishery-independent data sources with indices of abundance were included in the base model. These surveys sampled rocky habitat across the area `r area` (Figure \ref{fig:survey-locations}) in both areas opens to fishing (termed reference areas) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs, Figure \ref{fig:ref-mpa}).
