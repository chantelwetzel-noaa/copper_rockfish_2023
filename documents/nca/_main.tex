The model estimated uncertainty around the 2023 spawning output was \(\sigma\) = 0.22 and the uncertainty around the OFL was \(\sigma\) = 0.22. This is likely an underestimate of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix several population dynamic parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, female natural mortality) and no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature).

This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the California coast, north of Point Conception, using data through 2022.

Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. Copper rockfish are a demersal, relatively nearshore species within the subgenus \emph{Pteropodus.} Copper rockfish range from xxx to xx at depth of xxx (Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002). The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, with copper rockfish also found in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 100 meters in depth inhabiting nearshore kelp forests and complex low-relief rocky habitat (\textbf{love\_milton\_probably\_1996?}). Adult copper rockfish have high site fidelity and do not make long-range movements. An acoustic telemetry study diplaced copper rockfish 4km from their capture location to an artificial reef and within 10 days, half of the copper rockfish returned to the original capture location (\textbf{reynoldsApplicationAcousticTelemetry2010?}).

long the posterior two-thirds of the lateral line. The copper rockfish has high variation in coloration throughout its range, taking on coloration from dark brown, olive, orage-red and pink, with patches of yellow and pink (D. J. Miller and Lea 1972). In general the copper rockfish rockfish towards the northern part of the range are often darker in color than fish encountered in southern California. The distinct change in coloration resulted in copper rockfish described as two separate species, copper rockfish (\emph{S. caurinus}) and whitebelly rockfish (\emph{S. vexillaris}).

The \emph{Sebastes} genus are viviparous with internal fertilization, many exhibit dimorphic growth with females larger at size-at-age than males, and a number of species have reproductive strategies that vary with latitude. There are very few fecundity samples from copper rockfish available from available from California, although copper rockfish are assumed to produce a single brood annually. In southern California, peak parturition occurs xxxx central California peak parturition occurs in February and March.

The pelagic larvae are encountered in the CalCOFI surveys, but neither larval nor young-of-the-year (YOY) can be identified copper rockfish visually (Thompson et al. 2017). The size at birth ranges from 5-6 mm and the larvae remain pelagic until approximately 22-23 mm standard length at which time they recruit to the kelp forest canopy (T. W. Anderson 1983).

Juvenile Copper rockfish are indistinguishable from kelp (\emph{S. atrovirens}), black-and-yellow (\emph{S. chrysomelas}), and gopher rockfish (\emph{S. carnatus}), all of which recruit to the kelp forest canopy in the spring months. Copper rockfish is the first of the species group to recruit to the kelp forest from April to May and can be distinguished from the other species once it reaches a size around 50 mm standard length (T. W. Anderson 1983). Baetscher genetically identified YOY rockfish from surveys in Carmel and Monterey Bays in California and provided the authors with the length and genotyped species idenifications from her study (Baetscher et al. 2019). The average length of copper rockfish in July was 7 cm total length (fig: add figure). Anderson observed benthic copper rockfish nocturnally active over sandy bottom outside the kelp forest (T. W. Anderson 1983).

Copper rockfish are a relatively long-lived rockfish, estimated to live at least 50 years (\textbf{love\_milton\_probably\_1996?}). Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis (Cope et al. 2011). This analysis calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities.

As adults, there is little evidence of movement, with Hanan and CCFRP citations

copper rockfish are opportunistic carnivores and commonly consume crustaceans, mollusks, and fish whole (Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; \textbf{bizzarro\_diet\_2017-1?}). Prince -Prince (1972) observed a shift in a diet dominated by arthropods in age 0 and 1 fish, and a shift to a more diverse diet including molluscs and fish as they aged. the study also noted that juvenile copper rockfish were predated on by harbor seals and lingcod.

There is currently no evidence of significant stock structure from genetic studies of copper rockfish across the west coast. -Buonaccorsi et al. (2002) looked at genetic variation across six micosatellite DNA loci from samples ranging from British Columbia to southern California. Significant population subdivision was detected between th Puget Sound and coastal samples and support the model of isolation-by-distance for copper rockfish. Sivasundar and Palumbi (2010) conducted a genetic study to determine the potential for biogeographic boundaries to prohibit gene flow for 15 \emph{Sebastes} species. The study's sample sizes of copper rockfish with samples form Oregon, Monterey Bay and Santa Barbara. Sivasundar and Palumbi (2010) used mtDNA and could differentiate samples from Santa Barbara from those collected in Oregon and Monterey Bay, but the Monterey Bay and Oregon samples could not be distinguished. Micosatellite data did not reveal any genetic differentiation among the sampels from the three locations for copper rockfish and suggests low genetic differentiation coastwide.

The most recent genetic analysis of copper rockfish to date was conducted by Johansson et al. (2008). The study included 749 samples from along the west coast ranging from Neah Bay, Washington to San Diego, California with the majority of sampling locations clustered north of Cape Mendocino in northern California. The study included 185 samples collected within California. Eleven microsatellite DNA loci were analyzed. The study found significant evidence to support isolation by distance at the coast wide scale. Weak, but significant, genetic structure was identified from samples collected along the Oregon coast suggesting that habitat barriers may limit larval dispersal.

\subsection{Historical and Current Fishery Information}\label{historical-and-current-fishery-information}}

Off the coast of California, north of Point Conception, copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality, comprising nearly 85 percent of total removals of copper rockfish across all years (Table XX and Figure XX). The landings from the commercial fishery have been minimal by year, expect for a brief period between the mid-1980s and early-2000s.

The recreational fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, with expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time (R. R. Miller et al. 2014). Prior to the groundfish fishery being declared a federal disaster in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions ranging from 20 fm in the Northern Management Area to 60 fm in the Southern Management Area were put in place in various management area delineations along the state. This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including copper rockfish in the remaining open depths, though season lengths were greatly curtailed.

Following all previously overfished groundfish species, other than yelloweye rockfish, being declared rebuilt by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm and are currently 100 fm as of 2021. The increased access to deeper depths south of Point Conception with the rebuilding of cowcod is expected to reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent. To the north of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are prevalent, depth constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area. As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected, which will likely further reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent.

Prior to development of the live fish market in the 1980s, there was very little commercial catch of copper rockfish, with dead copper rockfish fetching a low ex-vessel price per pound. Copper rockfish were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as incidental catch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and, rarely, trawl gear. Trawling was prohibited within three miles of shore in 1953 and gill netting within three miles of shore was prohibited in 1994, preventing access to a high proportion of the species habitat with these gear types. Copper rockfish were caught along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as bycatch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for fish landed live arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market are lumped into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs.), with small, plate-sized, fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between \$5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery. The proportion of copper rockfish being landed live vs.~dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively.

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Wilson-Vandenberg, Larinto, and Key 2014). In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including the requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain copper rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date. The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.

Copper rockfish residing between Point Conception and the California/Oregon border are assessed here as a single, separate stock (Figure \ref{fig:map}). This designation was made based on oceanographic, geographic, and fishery conditions. The copper rockfish population in California waters was split at Point Conception due to water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish populations to the north and south. The northern border for this assessment was defined as the California/Oregon border due to substantial differences in historical and current exploitation levels. Additionally, the fairly sedentary nature of adult copper rockfish, likely limits flow of fish between northern California and areas to the north.

\section{Data}\label{data}}

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models. The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors. These factors often include, but are not limited to, the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency); the spatial and temporal coverage of the data; the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit; the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance; timing of when the data were provided; limitations imposed by the Terms of Reference; and the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model. Attributes associated with a data source can change through time, as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes). Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for copper rockfish. Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}) and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. Data that were excluded from the base model were explicitly explored during the development of this stock assessment or have not changed since their past exploration in a previous copper rockfish stock assessment. In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources were explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \ref{assessment-model}).

Commercial landings prior to 1969 were extracted from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) landings reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction (Ralston et al. 2010). Landings in this database are divided into trawl, non-trawl, and unknown gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. (2010) were assigned to south of Point Conception in California. Regions 2, 4, and 5 are associated with areas north of Point Conception. Region 6 in Ralston et al. (2010) included Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports north of Point Conception. To allocate landings from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. (2007) for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was north and south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition landings in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Landings from unknown locations (Region 0) were allocated proportional to the landings from known regions.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-1980 into the CALCOM database (Pearson, Erwin, and Key 2008). The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1980 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al. (2007) for further details. Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2022 were extracted from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database (extracted February 6, 2023). Landings were separated north and south of Point Conception based on port of landing. Commercial landings for copper rockfish were split into two fleets based on the fish landed condition, live or dead, and aggregated across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The selection of this fleet structure was based on potential differences in selectivity by the fishery based on fish landed condition where the live fish fishery may be targeting fish of particular sizes (i.e., plate sized). The first year where fish were observed to be landed live for copper rockfish in the area south of Point Conception was 1994.

Discarding was not estimated within the model. The commercial catches, landings plus discards, were estimated external to the model based on data from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The GEMM provides expanded estimates of landings, discard, and catches based on observed trips by sector split north and south of 40\(^\circ\) 10' N. lat. for the commercial fishery. Estimated landings and discards south of 40\(^\circ\) 10' N. lat. from select sectors (LE Fixed Gear DTL - Hook and Line, Nearshore, CS - Hook and Line, OA Fixed Gear - Hook and Line, OA Fixed Gear - Pot, and LE Fixed Gear DTL - Pot) were used to calculate a discard rate (total discard divided by the sum of landings and discards by year) for 2002-2021. The annual discard rates were applied to the total landings by year to calculate catches for both areas south and north of Point Conception. The median discard rate south of 40\(^\circ\) 10' N. lat. from the select sectors between 2002-2021 in the GEMM was 3 percent. This discard rate was applied to landings between 1916-2001 and 2022 to determine catch by year. The assumptions around the discard rate by year had limited impact to the assumed total catches given the limited scale of removals by the commercial fishery for copper rockfish. Across all years, 1916-2022, the landings were increased by 2-3 percent by area (11 mt south of Point Conception and 26 mt north of Point Conception) to calculate the total catches.

\hypertarget{composition-data}{%
\paragraph{Composition Data}\label{composition-data}}

Biological data were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System on March 20, 2023. Length data for the commercial fleet were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples for north↨ of Point Conception beginning in 1978 (Tables \ref{tab:dead-com-len} and \ref{tab:live-com-len}). The commercial data was split by landed condition, live or dead, with the first data for the live fish fishery beginning in 1994. The number of length samples by fleet were highly variable with the largest number of sample by year being recorded in the 1990s for the dead fish fishery. In recent years, the number of length samples by year are limited for both fleets with the live fish with annual sample sizes less than 100 per year. The number of samples prior to the 1990s and in the 2000s for the dead fish fishery were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations any year with less than 20 sampled fish were considered too sparse to accurately reflect the fleet selectivity for that year (see \protect\hyperlink{excluded-data}{Appendix A} for implied fits to these lengths).

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet landed dead copper rockfish ranged between approximately 25 - 50 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-len-data}, detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}). Notably, in the early years of data prior to 1990 observed few smaller fish compared to later years. The mean length observed by year ranged between approximately 30 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-dead-len-data}). The mean observed length since 2010 slowly increase through 2018 with a drop in the mean observed age in the most recent years data.

The observed distribution of sizes sampled from the commercial live fish fleet were generally variable prior to 2011 with the length distributions since indicating a smaller range of sizes being landed after 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-len-data}). The observed mean length of fish landed live also clearly shows a drop in average sizes being landing starting in 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-live-len-data}).

The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish across California. The recreational catches of copper rockfish south of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Catches declined in the 1990s and early 2000s (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The removals remained relatively low until 2015. Catches begun to increase in 2015, likely due to changes in harvest specifications (\textbf{cope\_data-moderate\_2013?}). The catches decreased in 2020 due to COVID-19 impacts and remained relatively low in 2021 and 2022 due to reductions in the sub-bag limits in California for copper rockfish. The recreational fishery was split into two fleets based on fishing type (termed `modes'), a commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV, party/charter mode) fleet and a combined private or rental boats (PR mode) and shoreside (man-made and beach/bank modes) fleet. The catches associated with the shoreside mode for copper rockfish are limited and did not justify a separate fishing fleet within the model.

Recreational landing estimates from 1928 to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction (Ralston et al. 2010). The historical landings reconstruction split removals north and south of Point Conception and by recreational modes. CPFV landings of all rockfish were based on logbook data (which do not report rockfish to the species level), scaled by compliance estimates, while total recreational landings from PR vessels were based on a combination of the relative catch rates observed in the CPFV fleet and a linear ramp between catch estimates in the early 1960s and those in the early 1980s (as described in Ralston et al. (2010)). The species composition of rockfish landings was estimated using a combination of the 1980s Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) data as well as limited CPFV mode species composition data from onboard observer programs in the late 1970s (south of Point Conception) and dockside recreational creel surveys in the late 1950s and early 1960s (north of Point Conception).

Recreational removals from 1981-1989 and 1993-2003 were obtained from MRFSS downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN). Historically, copper rockfish were occasionally referred to as whitebelly rockfish in select California areas. MRFSS catches were pulled for both species names and for all ocean areas. MRFSS includes estimates of removals for 1980. However, due to inconsistencies in the estimates of this year in MRFSS, likely due to it being the first year of the survey with low sample sizes, the value for recreational landings from the historical reconstruction were used (2010).

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) a change in the spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, 2) missing or imprecise estimates of catch in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, and 3) a hiatus in sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode north of Point Conception. The STAT attempted to address each of these issues, as described below. CRFS estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are included with the MRFSS catch estimate tables

The MRFSS definition of ``Southern California'' included San Luis Obispo County between 1981-1989, requiring the catches from this county to be split out and removed from the recreational catch south of Point Conception. The MRFSS catches between southern and northern California were adjusted in a similar fashion as previous assessments split at Point Conception. Albin et al. (1993) used MRFSS data to estimate catch at a finer spatial scale from the California/Oregon border to the southern edge of San Luis Obispo (SLO) County. Over the period 1981-1986, numbers of copper rockfish landed in SLO County were found to be approximately one third (0.317) of the numbers of copper rockfish landed in all California counties north of SLO County (Albin, Karpov, and Van Buskirk 1993). Therefore, to approximate catches north and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the `southern' subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by 0.317 during the same period, and added this amount to the northern subregion catch. On average, this `moves' the estimated SLO County catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series.

The STAT chose to use catch in terms of weight (WGT\_AB1 column) within MRFSS. The catch weights were converted from kilograms to metric tons and any records with missing catch weights were examined. The number of records with missing catch weights for copper rockfish in MRFSS were limited (only 18 out of 713). The missing catch weights were imputed based on the number of fish (TOT\_CAT column) and the calculated average fish weight by year and area north and south of Point Conception.

MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County. To produce catch estimates for the missing subregion, mode, and year combinations linear interpolations were used to fill in the missing data.

Two additional revisions were applied to select years and modes in the MRFSS data based on conversations with California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The catches for the PR mode north of Point Conception in MRFSS for 1981 were 50 to 90 percent greater than the catches in 1980 and 1982, respectively. The high catches in this year were assumed to be a result of issues in the catch expansions due to limited sampling. The catches for the PR fleet were revised downward to be equal to the average removals in surrounding years (1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983). The catches in MRFSS south of Point Conception in 1987 were identified as abnormally low by CDFW (John Budrick, pers. communication, 13 to 27 percent of catches in 1986 and 1988) which was due to no catch information for waves 1-3 (January - June) for either mode. Absence of data in 1987 for these waves was not observed across other rockfish species in southern California indicating that the absence of catch data was likely not due to closures in the fishery. The catches for this year and mode were set equal to the average catch by mode 2 years before and after 1987.

Recreational landings from 2004-2022 were obtained from California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) available on RecFIN for for all ocean areas. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, employing higher sampling rates and producing estimates with finer spatial and temporal resolution. CRFS also employs onboard CPFV observers, providing spatially referenced, drift-level estimates of catch and discard for a subset of anglers on observed groundfish trips. Any CRFS records of fish caught in Mexican waters were removed and catch estimates were split north and south of Point Conception for each fleet. Due to database issues, catches for 2004 are currently not available on RecFIN. The catches for this year were set equal to data pulled in 2021 for the previous assessment of copper rockfish.

Adjustments to the recreational catches for 2020-2022 were provided directly by CDFW to deal with sampling issues due to COVID-19. During 2020 dockside sampling by observers was halted April through June leading to missing catch data within the CRFS database for this period. CDFW provided proxy catch values for these months directly by CRFS district (personal communication, Melanie Parker). The total proxy catches south of Point Conception (districts 1 and 2) for these months were 18.9 mt and 15.0 mt north of Point Conception in California (districts 3 - 6). These catches were split by mode (CPFV and PR) equally for both areas, noting that effort by mode during this period varied across district based on varying COVID-19 restrictions. When sampling resumed a large number of rockfish catches were not identified to species, recorded as rockfish genus, for the remainder of 2020 and 2021 due to social distancing for health and safety. The second adjustment to catches was to allocated unidentified rockfish catches. CDFW provided proxy catch values that allocated a subset of the rockfish genus removals by recreational mode north and south of Point Conception for these years. Finally, the completed catch estimates for 2022 were not available within CRFS on RecFIN by the data deadline for this assessment and estimates were provided directly to the STAT from CDFW.

MRFSS and CRFS both provide estimates of total mortality which combine observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish using depth-dependent mortality rates. While the recreational removals from the historical reconstruction from 1928-1980 account for only landed fish. There is limited information on historical discarding in the recreational fishery. A report by Miller and Gotshall (1965) looked at the number of retained and discard fish in the recreational fishery in California for a select year which showed essentially no discarding of copper rockfish. Based on that no additional discards were applied to the historical data between 1926-190.

The number of available fish and unique trips by year and fleet are in Tables \ref{tab:rec-len-samps}. MRFSS historical biological data were downloaded from RecFIN website in December 2022. CRFS biological data were also downloaded from RecFIN on February 18, 2023. The Miller and Goshall, Don Person, Deb-Wilson Vandenberg recreational survey data were downloaded from the SWFSC databases in February 2023.

Between 1987 - 1989 and 1993-1998 there were recreational length data for the CPFV fleet from both MRFSS and Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data sets. During data exploration it was determined that the lengths in MRFSS from 1997 and 1998 were also included in the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg indicating that these data sources were duplicative for these years but also potentially other years where they overlapped. In order to avoid double using of data, the length data from MRFSS which had far fewered length samples for the overlapping years with Deb Wilson-Vandenberg for the CPFV fleet were removed from the data used within the model (see \protect\hyperlink{excluded-data}{Appendix A} for implied fits to these lengths).

The majority of length samples for both recreational fleets, CPFV and PR, were unsexed. A wide range of sampled lengths from the recreational CPFV fleet were observed across all years with lengths generally ranging between 25 - 45 cm except for the late 1970s and early 1980s where a higher proportion of larger fish were sampled (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-len-data}). The mean length of lengths observed in the recreational CPFV fleet since approximately 1990s is relatively stable varying between 35 - 40 cm in length with high variability within the data in the early years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-cpfv-len-data}). The range of lengths sampled from the recreational PR fleet are similar to those from the CPFV fleet with lengths in recent years ranging between 25 - 45 cm with slightly larger proportion of larger fish observed in the 1980s (Figures \ref{fig:rec-pr-len-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rec-pr-len-data}).

Age composition data were available for select years from both the recreational CPFV and PR fleets. Historical age data collected from the CPFV fishery were available from this fleet from 1978, 1981, and 1984. The majority of these fish were sexed (only 4 total unsexed ages from 1978 and 1984) with an average age ranging from 10 to 14 across these years (Figures \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-age-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rec-cpfv-ag-data}). The historical age data from this fleet were input as marginal ages. There were a total of 250 age samples from the final model year, 2022, collected by a cooperative sampling program with the fleet coordinated by the SWFSC (Figures \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-caal-data} and ADD MARGINAL FIGURE). These data were collected by three CPFV vessels that operate north of Point Conception following random sampling protocols. The cooperative ages were compared to all the CPFV lengths collected by the CRFS sampling program to ensure that the sampling was representative of the fishery (Figure \ref{fig:coop-len-comparison} North). These ages were incorporated as either marginal or conditional age-at-length data depending upon how fish length were measured: carcass or whole fish. The carcass lengthed fish were included as marginals in order to avoid any potential measurement bias in the use of these ages. Finally, a total of 139 ages were collected from the PR fleet in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig: rec-pr-caal-data}). These data were used in the model as conditional age-at-length data as well.

The approach to determine the number of unique trips by data source varied. Some data sources had unique trip numbers within the data (Don Pearson, Deb Wilson Vandenberg). Other data sources that lacked clear trip identifier applied a similar methodology as developed by Brian Soper that combines multiple fields of information to attempt to estimate trips sampled. The number of trips for MRFSS data was estimated using the year, wave, ID code, sampling site (INSITE), area, and mode. A similar methodology was done for CRFS and Miller and Gotshall data that used data, county, water area, interview site, and mode.

Since 2007, the \gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \glspl{mpa} and understand nearshore fish populations (Starr et al. 2015; Wendt and Starr 2009). In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California (Año Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast. Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \glspl{cpfv} guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \glspl{mpa}. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth; since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) have been conducting remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys along the California coast in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reference sites adjacent to them since 2004 for the purposes of long-term monitoring of changes in size, density (fish/square meter) and length of fish and invertebrate species along the California coast. Surveys of the entire coast have now been undertaken twice, each taking three years to complete, 2014-2016 and again in 2019-2021. The survey conducted multiple 500 meter transects across rocky reef survey sites. Sample sites were selected by first randomly selecting the deepest transect at a given site, then selecting transects on a constant interval into shallower depths. Transects were designed to be oriented parallel to general depth contours, though they were carried out using a fixed bearing that crossed depths in some cases.

The data were explored using a super year approach where the central years, 2015 and 2020, were designated as the super year and the data were split north and south of Point Conception. The effort of the survey were split roughly equally between sites that were within MPAs or areas open to fishing (referred to as ``Reference'') with sampling across most sites (termed ``MPA group'') within each super year. The number of transects and the number of copper rockfish by site and super year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-obs} with the number of observations across all years by location shown in Figure \ref{fig:rov-obs-loc}. The trend in the calculated catch-per-unit-effort based on the data alone was highly variable across sampling locations and by MPA or Reference area (Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).

CDFW provided an initial analysis of the CDFW ROV survey data which helped form the considered modeling approaches for these data. The final selected model was assumed a negative binomial error structure with covariates for super year, site designation (MPA or Reference), and super year site designation interaction. The estimated index of abundance based on the proportion of hard substrate either in MPA (20 percent) or Reference (80 percent) areas in California north of Point Conception. The weighted index of abundance increases between the two super years 2015 and 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:rov-index-main}). Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes, and model selection can be found in the Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index}.

\hypertarget{composition-data-3}{%
\paragraph{Composition Data}\label{composition-data-3}}

CDFW provided annual fish length measurement made from images taken with stereo-cameras in 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:rov-len}). The corresponding length data were weighted by MPA/Reference area and were grouped by super year (Figure \ref{fig:rov-len-data}). The input sample size was set equal to the weighted number of unique transects north of Point Conception.

\hypertarget{growth-data}{%
\subsubsection{Growth Data}\label{growth-data}}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age not associated with fishery fleets or surveys incorporated in the model were available for copper rockfish. These independent age data collection efforts from four programs north of Point Conception since 2001: 227 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 430 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 45 otoliths from CDFW special collections, and 77 otoliths collected by Abrams research program, and (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these three sources were included in the model as a ``growth'' fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. These collection had a wide distribution of length and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).

\subsubsection{Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey}\label{northwest-fisheries-science-center-west-coast-groundfish-bottom-trawl-survey}}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m (Bradburn, Keller, and Horness 2011). This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

\subsection{Biological Data}\label{biological-data}}

\hypertarget{natural-mortality}{%
\subsubsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality}}

Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the Hamel (2022) method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. (2015) functional regression model and is a commonly applied method for West Coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

The Hamel (2022) method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments combines meta-analytic approaches relating the \(M\) rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior for \(M\). The Hamel (2022) method re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. (2015) by fitting the one-parameter \(A_{\text{max}}\) model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space (Hamel 2015), the point estimate and median of the prior for \(M\) is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where \(A_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean \(ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})\) and standard error = 0.31. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values. The oldest aged copper rockfish observed in California waters was 52 years of age sampled in 2020 in northern California with 15 additional fish aged to be 40 years and older across all data sources.

The maximum age in the model was set at 50 years. This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish within California (\textbf{love\_milton\_probably\_1996?}) and was supported by the observed ages that had multiple observations of fish between 40 and 52 years of age.

\hypertarget{maturation-and-fecundity}{%
\subsubsection{Maturation and Fecundity}\label{maturation-and-fecundity}}

Maturity-at-length was based on maturity reads conducted by Melissa Head at the NWFSC examining a total of 112 samples (18 north of Point Conception and 94 south of Point Conception) collected across California by the NWFSC Hook and Line survey and \Gls{s-wcgbt} collected in September and October. Given the limited sample size north of Point Conception, all samples were pooled across California to inform maturity north of Point Conception, while only samples south of Point Conception were used to inform maturity in this region.

The maturity-at-length curve is based on an estimate of functional maturity rather than biological maturity. Biological maturity can include multiple behaviors that functional will exclude (e.g., abortive maturation and skip spawning). Biological maturity indicates that some energy reserves were used to create vitellogenin, but it does not mean that eggs will continue to develop and successfully spawn. This includes juvenile abortive maturation. Female rockfish commonly go through the first stages of spawning the year before they reach actual spawning capability. This is most likely a factor related to their complicated reproductive process of releasing live young. A subset of oocytes will develop early yolk, and then get aborted during the spawning season. Biological maturity also does not account for the proportion of oocytes in atresia (cellular breakdown and reabsorption), which means that fish that were skipping spawning for the season could be listed as biologically mature and functionally immature (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).

The 50 percent size-at-maturity was estimated at 34 cm with a slope of -0.41 (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}). This area-specific maturity-at-length estimate is relatively similar but with fish maturing at a slightly larger size compared to the biological maturity curve assumed for copper rockfish south of Point Conception. Additionally, these values are both slightly smaller compared to estimates by Hannah (2014) for fish observed in Oregon waters (34.8 cm) which estimated the 50 percent size-at-maturity of and slope of -0.60.

The fecundity-at-length was based on research from Dick et al. (\textbf{dick\_meta-analysis\_2017?}). The fecundity relationship for copper rockfish was estimated equal to 3.362e-07\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.68} in millions of eggs where \(L\) is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.

\hypertarget{sex-ratio}{%
\subsubsection{Sex Ratio}\label{sex-ratio}}

There were limited sex-specific observations by length or age across biological data sources. The sex ratio of copper rockfish by length and age across all available data sources off the West Coast are shown in Figure \ref{fig:frac-sex-len}. The sex ratio of young fish was assumed to be 1:1.

\hypertarget{length-weight-relationship}{%
\subsubsection{Length-Weight Relationship}\label{length-weight-relationship}}

The length-weight relationship for copper rockfish was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the NWFSC Hook and Line survey. The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was W = 9.6e-06\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.19} and males 1.11e-05\(L\)\textsuperscript{3.15} where \(L\) is length in cm and W is weight in kilograms (Figure \ref{fig:weight-length}).

\hypertarget{length-at-age}{%
\subsubsection{Growth (Length-at-Age)}\label{length-at-age}}

Length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish informed by age data from the fisheries, the CCFRP survey, and independent age data collected effort from three programs \texttt{area} since 2002: 207 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 426 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 74 from a research survey conducted by Abrams, 45 from CDFW special collections, and 210 otoliths collected by a cooperative research survey by the SWFSC and CPFV funded by the Sportfishing Association of California (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these three sources were included in the model as a ``growth'' fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance.

Sex-specific growth parameters \texttt{area} were initially estimated external to the model at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.5 cm; $L_1$ = 9.1 cm; $k$ = 0.174 per year

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 46.8 cm; $L_1$ = 5.3 cm; $k$ = 0.207 per year

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.50cm}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female copper rockfish.

\hypertarget{ageing-precision-and-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Ageing Precision and Bias}\label{ageing-precision-and-bias}}

Uncertainty surrounding the age-reading error process for copper rockfish was incorporated by estimating ageing error by age. Age composition data used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads. Aged copper rockfish used in the assessment were aged by the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) in Newport, Oregon. Within-lab ageing error was estimated for CAP based on one primary age reader and a second reader producing double reads from 875 otoliths provided by the CAP lab (Figure \ref{fig:age-error-dist}).

An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using a computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error (Punt et al. 2008) and using release 1.1.0 of the R package \href{https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} (\textbf{thorson\_nwfscageingerror:\_2012?}) for input and output diagnostics. A linear standard error was estimated by age where there is more variability in the age of older fish (Figures \ref{fig:age-error} and \ref{fig:age-error-matrix}). Sensitivities to alternative ageing error estimates (curvilinear relationship with age) were conducted during model development and the model was relatively insensitive to alternative ageing error assumptions.

\subsubsection{History of Modeling Approaches}\label{history-of-modeling-approaches}}

Copper rockfish was first assessed in 2013 (\textbf{cope\_data-moderate\_2013?}) using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA), a data-moderate approach, which incorporated catch and index data with priors on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, split north and south of Point Conception. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock south of Point Conception at 75 percent of unfished spawning output and the stock north of Point Conception at 48 percent of unfished spawning output.

Copper rockfish was last assessed in 2021 using a length-based data moderate assessment approach that included catch, fishery independent index data, and length composition data (Wetzel et al. 2021; \textbf{wetzel\_status\_2021-1?}). The 2021 assessment estimated \(R_0\) and select selectivity parameters with fixed growth and deterministic annual recruitment. The 2021 assessments comprised four regional assessment models for copper rockfish with two model-areas within California split north and south of Point Conception. The estimated stock status in 2021 for the portion of the population south of Point Concept was 18 percent of unfished spawning output, while the California portion of the population north of Point Conception was 39 percent of unfished spawning output.

\hypertarget{most-recent-star-panel-and-ssc-recommendations}{%
\subsubsection{Most Recent STAR Panel and SSC Recommendations}\label{most-recent-star-panel-and-ssc-recommendations}}

This is the first benchmark assessment for Copper rockfish off the coast of California. The previous assessment of this species was a data-moderate assessment conducted in 2021 that were reviewed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee. The following items were identified at that time for future assessments of copper rockfish to consider:

\textbf{Issue}: The model for Northern California estimated a pattern of high recruitment during the 1960s and lower recruitment during the 1970s, which is not consistent with trends in the recuitment for other rockfishes during that time.

\textbf{Response}:

\textbf{Issue}: Concerns were raised regarding the declining trend in the recent time period of the Southern California model, which is inconsistent with population trends from other southern California stocks for which data are available (e.g., bocaccio, cowcod), most of which have seen signs of strong recruitment over the past decade.

\textbf{Response}: The previous data-moderate assessment that incorporated catch, length, and survey indices was unable to estimate annual recruitment deviations in the south of Point Conception model due to lack of information in the data to inform these estimates. This assessment included additional data sources including available age data that supported the estimation of annual recruitment. The south of Point Conception model estimated high recruitment since 2010 similar to trends observed for other rockfish species that have been recently assessed (bocaccio, vermilion/sunset rockfish). Estimates of recruitment were not compared to the most recent cowcod assessment since this model did not estimate annual recruitment deviations.

\textbf{Issue}: Age-length estimates (and hence the growth curve) for northern California may not be representative because they rely on data from Oregon and Washington where water temperatures are different and growth may differ as a result.

\textbf{Response}: Available age data from a range of sources were included within each sub-are model to support area specific growth for copper rockfish. The majority of the age data that were available to support estimation of growth within the model in the area north of Point Conception (e.g., otoliths collected by the CPFV fleet within a cooperative sampling program coordinated by the SWFSC) were not available for consideration in 2021.

\textbf{Issue}: The fit to the {[}NWFSC{]} hook-and-line survey in the Southern California assessment was poor. This likely reflects differences in the composition from the fishery disproportionately reflecting areas open to fishing closer to port as compared to the more spatially balanced sampling of the survey, more equally representing habitat offshore and in the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) and in the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs).

\textbf{Response}: It is important to note that the 2021 assessment of copper rockfish south of Point Conception did not estimate annual recruitment deviations which likely limited the ability to fit the variable trends in the index of abundance from the NWFSC Hook and Line survey. However, the NWFSC Hook and Line survey data did appear to see the largest proportion of larger sizes compared to the other surveys and was the only survey with asymptotic selectivity. This is likely due to the sampling locations that would require overnight trips to access from many mainland ports.

\textbf{Issue}: California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) quantified the percent of habitat in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), CCAs and RCAs, along with charts for further consideration to make clear the amount of habitat that is not represented in recent years. Data from the recreational fishery only represents areas open to fishing, potentially making the stock appear more depleted than it is as a whole. Two-area models, estimates of biomass from recently reviewed CDFW remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys, and inclusion of the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program that sample in MPAs can be incorporated in future assessments to help reflect differences in composition and fishing mortality in open and closed areas. Additional data to represent the composition in closed areas would be beneficial.

\textbf{Response}: Data from the CDFW ROV survey were not available for consideration in 2021. Additionally, estimates of the percent of habitat within and outside of MPAs and CCAs were provided by CDFW the data of the SSC review in 2021 which precluded their consideration for how to process data or model copper rockfish in 2021. This assessment was able to include survey data from two sources that do sampling inside and outside of MPAs in California: the CDFW ROV and the CCFRP survey. In order to properly weight composition data and abundance data collected within and outside MPAs estimates of rocky habitat were developed for the area south of Point Conception from partial seafloor mapping data (see Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index} for detailed information). The area north of Point Conception has complete seafloor mapping data which has been used to inform data weighting as was done in the 2021 assessment of vermilion/sunset rockfish.

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.20 developed by Dr.~Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC (Methot and Wetzel 2013). This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions. The previous assessment of copper rockfish also used Stock Synthesis but an earlier version, 3..30.16; model bridging was performed between both versions of Stock Synthesis and discussed below. The R package \href{https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss}{r4ss}, version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.

\hypertarget{model-selection-and-evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Model Selection and Evaluation}\label{model-selection-and-evaluation}}

The base assessment model for copper rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of copper rockfish off the west coast of the U.S. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

\hypertarget{bridging-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Bridging Analysis}\label{bridging-analysis}}

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2021 data-moderate assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.20, which produced the same estimates for spawning biomass and depletion across the time series (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}).

\hypertarget{priors}{%
\subsubsection{Priors}\label{priors}}

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel (2022) meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 50 years. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1} and a standard error of 0.31.

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard error of 0.15. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA), which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) have been conducting remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys along the California coast in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reference sites adjacent to them since 2004 for the purposes of long-term monitoring of changes in size, density (fish/square meter) and length of fish and invertebrate species along the California coast. Surveys of the entire coast have now been undertaken twice, each taking three years to complete, 2014-2016 and again in 2019-2021. The survey conducted multiple 500 meter transects across rocky reef survey sites. Sample sites were selected by first randomly selecting the deepest transect at a given site, then selecting transects on a constant interval into shallower depths. Transects were designed to be oriented parallel to general depth contours, though they were carried out using a fixed bearing that crossed depths in some cases.

Given that each pass of the California coast took a three year period, the STAT opted to explore using the data either by year or grouping it into super years. The selected super years were 2015 and 2020, the middle year of the time grouped sampling efforts. Based on the life history of copper rockfish and the generally limited movement of adult copper rockfish, the super year approach was considered for each model area in order to include these data within the model limited given the range of the survey area each year across the California coast, the super year application. The two sub-area models for copper rockfish represent disparate proportions of the California coast where the model south of Point Conception has a greatly reduced spatial range compared to the model area north of Point Conception. South of Point Conception nearly all sampling locations were visited either three or four times within the six year sampling period (only one reference location only visited one year) while sampling locations north of Point Conception were visited between two to four times within the six sampling years. These differences in sampling frequency and the areas being sampled informed the selection of modeling these data different by area. The data south of Point Conception were modeled using the sample year while the data north of Point Conception were modeled using super years.

Minimal filtering were done to the data. Transects were removed based on four factors: 1) extreme estimates of effort (the estimated area of view below the ROV termed usable area), 2) any locations that were not sampled by both super year periods, 3) transect that were conducted crossing from MPA into reference areas, and 4) transects conducted across depths that never observed copper rockfish within the survey (Table \ref{tab:rov-filtered}). Once the data were filtered the average calculated CPUE for each MPA and Reference groups were plotted to visualize the data (Table \ref{tab:rov-obs} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).

A range of alternative model structures were explored to generate an index of abundances including alternative error structures, covariates, and factors were considered when exploring how best to model these data. Based on model selection a model with super year, site designation (MPA or Reference), and super year site designation interaction was selected (Table \ref{tab:rov-model-selection}). A negative-binomial model was selected based on the distribution of the data and diagnostics (Figures \ref{fig:rov-qq} and \ref{fig:rov-prop-zero}) using sdmTMB (S. C. Anderson et al. 2022). The model estimates were then area-weighted based on the estimated percent of habitat within MPAs based on habitat seafloor mapping data within state waters were north of Point Conception an estimate of 20\% of rocky habitat within MPAs and 80\% open to fishing. The weighted relative index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-index} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-index}.
