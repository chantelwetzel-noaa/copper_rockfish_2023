### California Department of Fish and Wildlife Remotely Operated Vehicle Survey

#### Index of Abundance 
\

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) have been conducting remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys along the California coast in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and reference sites adjacent to them since 2004 for the purposes of long-term monitoring of changes in size, density (fish/square meter) and length of fish and invertebrate species along the California coast. Surveys of the entire coast have now been undertaken twice, each taking three years to complete, 2014-2016 and again in 2019-2021. The survey conducted multiple 500 meter transects across rocky reef survey sites. Sample sites were selected by first randomly selecting the deepest transect at a given site, then selecting transects on a constant interval into shallower depths. Transects were designed to be oriented parallel to general depth contours, though they were carried out using a fixed bearing that crossed depths in some cases.

The data were explored using a super year approach where the central years, 2015 and 2020, were designated as the super year and the data were split north and south of Point Conception. The effort of the survey were split roughly equally between sites that were within MPAs or areas open to fishing (referred to as "Reference") with sampling across most sites (termed "MPA group") within each super year. The number of transects and the number of `r spp` by site and super year are shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-obs}. South of Point Conception the ROV survey generally see the largest numbers of `r spp` north of the Channel Islands similar to the `r hkl` (Figure \ref{fig:rov-obs-loc}). The trend in the calculated catch-per-unit-effort based on the data alone was highly variable across sampling locations and by MPA or Reference area (Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).   

CDFW provided an initial analysis of the CDFW ROV survey data which helped form the considered modeling approaches for these data. 

The STAT explored alternative model structures to generate a standardized index of relative abundance for this survey. The final model selected was a model
