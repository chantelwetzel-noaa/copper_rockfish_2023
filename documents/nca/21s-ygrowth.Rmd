### Growth Data {#growth-data}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age data not associated with fishery fleets or surveys incorporated in the model were available for `r spp`. These independent age data collection efforts were derived from four programs `r area` since 2001: 227 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 430 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 45 otoliths from CDFW special collections, and 77 otoliths collected by Jeff Abrams research program, and  (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these four sources were included in the model as a "growth" fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. These collections had a wide distribution of lengths and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).
