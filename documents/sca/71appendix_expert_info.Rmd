## Information Provided by the Commercial and Recreational Fleet Representatives


The copper rockfish STAT held the following three informal virtual meetings with stakeholders as part of the data exploration process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Copper Rockfish & the Commercial Fisheries on January 10, 2023 (24 attendees)
\item Copper Rockfish  & the Recreational Fishery South of Pt. Conception on January 23, 2023 (17 attendees)
\item  & the Recreational Fishery North of Pt. Conception on January 30, 2023 (19 attendees)
\end{enumerate}


A summary of the information learned from these meetings is provided here. We would like to thank everyone who participated in our virtual meetings for their willingness to participate in the stock assessment process and provided additional insight into the fisheries for copper rockfish.

### Preferred Habitat and Life History Notes

Coppers are "king" of the reef and appear to push other species off of the best habitat within a reef. The STAT consistently heard from all fishermen that copper rockfish are not caught in areas of high relief. Copper rockfish prefer areas of flatter or broken hard bottom, and also venture out over soft bottom habitat. It is often larger fish caught over soft bottom where they are feeding on sanddabs. Copper rockfish do not feed on pyrosomes as frequently as other rockfish species.  Copper rockfish will follow prey targets, especially the pelagic red crabs that have been observed farther north.
In general rockfish catches decreased when prey (anchovies, mychtophids, and pyrosomes) are more abundance. 

Onotogenetic shift and seasonal movements. Copper also tend to move based on weather conditions. North of \PtC, coppers cannot be found during bad weather and seem to move to deeper waters (swell and wind). 

### Commercial Fishery

To fish copper rockfish commercial in California a deeper nearshore permit is needed.  The trip limits of 75 pounds per two month period in combinations with depth restrictions has impacted the commercial targeting of copper rockfish. The fleet is descending more fish now with the lower quotas. Copper rockfish are a component of the live fish fishery in both northern and southern California. They are intended to be sold live, but those fish that do not live will still be commercially sold as dead fish. Historically (pre RCAs), copper were found predominately in 45-80 fm. Coppers are encountered at an average depth of 45 fm, but can be found out to 60 fm. Copper are rarely seen outside of 60 fm.

The live fish market is constantly in flux and can be difficult to predict. In southern California, a large portion of the live fish fishery collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned. A fisherman's market in San Diego has allowed individuals to sell fish to the public.  Many of the live fish buyers in central California transport live fish to Las Vegas, Nevada or Los Angeles and San Jose in California. 

North of Point Conception, copper rockfish is a target of the commercial fleet. North of Cape Mendocino (\CapeM), live fish sell for 3-4 times the price of dead copper. For fishermen targeting black rockfish in the north copper rockfish are incidental catch and still sold. Out of Morro Bay, coppers ranging between 1-6 pounds are most common in the 10-15 fm range and also sell for $7-8 a pound. In shallow waters, fishermen will use traps for the live fish fleet and vertical gear for deeper waters. In central California (near Morro Bay) the nearshore live fish live in the kelp beds and larger coppers on the outside edges of the reef - you can find larger coppers on isolated outcrops. It's rare for the commercial live fleet to fish outside fo 90 ft, and in central California it's harder to keep fish exhibiting barotrauma alive, and the price of live fish much higher.

Commercial fishermen from multiple areas along the coast emphasized that the price difference for copper by size is not as pronounced as it is for other species landed in the live fish fishery. North of San Francisco, the commercial fleet encounters larger copper rockfish (~ 7 pounds) in general.  Fish smaller than 2.5 - 3 pounds (approximately 14-17 inches) are desired by the live fish buyers and the restaurant market and will sell for a higher price, and the larger fish can be sold to the general public.

South of Point Conception, copper rockfish are not generally a target species for the live fishery and have been difficult to market. The fleet is now marketing copper rockfish in southern California to a species as close to the popular "grouper" (bocaccio rockfish) and it is increasing interest. The majority of commercial caught copper rockfish in southern California are sold dead.  The price of a dead copper in San Diego is around $6 a pound. The fleet can keep copper alive from depths up to 60 fms with no issue and seem to be the hardiest of the rockfish species. 

### Recreational Fishery

In 1997 there were approximately 295 CPFVs in California and in 2022 that number was reduced to 193 active Coast Guard inspected CPFVs, vessels that can carry 7 or more passengers. Of the 193 CPFVs in the state, 78 fish offshore exclusively. The number of active 6-pack vessels is much less.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced loads were required on the CPFVs to maintain distancing among passengers.  Customers preferred the reduced loads that resulted in a less crowded vessel and have been willing to pay the increased charter costs to maintain the reduced loads post-COVID. This is true along the entire coast of California for Coast Guard inspected vessels.

#### North of Point Conception

The majority of vessels north of Bodega Bay are 6-packs. Vessels fishing out of Eureka generally fish closer to shore due to weather and fuel costs. The target in this area is salmon, and vessels will switch to rockfish especially if salmon are not biting.

Larger coppers can be found in 40-60 feet of water and swell is a good indicator for the presence of copper rockfish. If there's swell, the copper rockfish remain close to the bottom and are not as active, i.e., reduced chance of catching coppers.  In Eureka, copper are a desirable species in the recreational fleet due to their larger average size. Coppers won't be caught more than 5-10 fm off the bottom. 

In central California, small coppers can be found in 100+ feet of water at the edge of the Farallon Islands. The last 2-3 weeks of December, fishermen out of Emeryville, CA find aggregations of copper rockfish that are not usually present on shale beds.

Small copper rockfish have been caught off the the jetties in Humboldt, Pillar Point Harbor, and San Francisco, California. In the Half Moon Bay CFPV fleet, coppers are rarely observed shallower than 35 fathoms and they tend to only bite the bottom hook. The gear regulations from unlimited hooks to 2 hooks per line and a one pole limit in 1999-2000 resulted in increased loss of fish to sea lions. 

#### South of Point Conception

After the depth restrictions and other closures the fleet moved to different fishing ground and the desire for copper rockfish increased retention. Over half of the habitat regularly fished by the 1/2 vessels out of Mission Bay in San Diego is now in protected areas closed to fishing and the depth closures moved effort from offshore to inshore <50-60fm starting in 2001. The effort of the fleet in southern California shifts during the summer months to pelagic species and kelp and sand bass, the timing of which is dependent on ocean temperatures. There is more pressure on the rockfish stocks during cold water years.

The business of the recreational fleet is tied to the state of the economy. When fuel prices are high there are fewer boats fishing. Around 2014/2014 as the economy recovered, business started increasing. 
In 2022, the CPFV fleet in southern California made a concerted effort to avoid copper rockfish grounds, and when copper rockfish were encountered, encouraged their clients to descend the fish. Anglers who were not catching as many fish were more interested in retaining their copper rockfish.

In general, there is less rocky habitat in southern California compared to northern California. In southern California towards San Diego, coppers are typically found in less than 35 fm with juveniles in less than 10 fm. In some areas, size classes of coppers are mixed and are not caught deeper than 60 fm.

A portion of the U.S. fleet fishes rockfish in Mexican waters where there are some known areas of higher copper rockfish density. At the Coronado Islands in Mexico, coppers are typically found in 28-35 fm on low relief habitat. Fishing is more consistent in Mexican waters.

The activity of private vessels is depending on ocean conditions, the vessel's size/range, and fuel costs. Private vessels of >25 feet are usually focused on pelagic species and will fish rockfish during the transit to or from HMS grounds.  It's difficult for the private anglers to access offshore waters at depths of 50+ fm.


### Additional Notes of Interest

Some of the meeting attendees participate in Cooperative Research, such as the NWFSC Hook-and-Line survey, the CCFRP survey and the SWFSC Cooperative Sampling Program.

During the NWFSC hook-and-line survey, there have been times when the vermilion and widow rockfish are abundant and the lines are reeled in before even reaching the bottom where copper are encountered. Anglers who previously participated in ROV studies with NMFS observed rockfish species moving to the bottom and hiding in crevices when the ground swell reached 6-7 ft. There's interest in participation in future ROV surveys.  

We heard interest from the CPFV fleet in deploying CTDs during their trips. Fishermen are interested in tagging fish they release.

The number one question posed to the STAT at all meetings was, "How will the stock assessment account for closed areas?" The fleet would like to see some accounting for these areas in the assessment models.
