### Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook and Line

#### Index of Abundance 
\

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-map}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the `r hkl` are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers fishing with a line with 5 hooks across a total of 5 drops per site). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008]. 

From 2004 through 2013, sampling was conducted only outside the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs). Beginning in 2014, 40 sites inside the CCAs were sampled, and roughly another 40 sites have been added in subsequent years inside the CCAs. It is important to note that some portions of the CCAs allow take for select species at depths less that 73 meters. The survey currently has 201 sites (79 inside and 122 outside the CCAs). Additionally, 16 stations within the original sample design sample areas that have been converted into either state or federal MPAs between 2007 - 2011.  

`r Spp` have been observed at multiple sampling sites by the `r hkl` each year between 2004 - 2022 (Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-obs}). Across all sample years and sample sites the `r hkl`  has observed a total of 1,213 `r spp`. While `r spp` have been observed both outside and inside the CCAsin areas that restric take or MPAs (Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-site}), the vast majority of observations of `r spp` have been in open areas (1,060 observations, Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-obs}).  The number of `r spp` observations within the no take areas of the CCAs or MPA and open areas was explored to determine if the catch rates of `r spp` differed among the areas which determined there was not a significant different in the observations among these areas. Additionally, the data from the `r hkl` was broken out into three regions: mainland, Northern Channel Islands, and Southern Channel Islands.  The highest catch rate of `r spp` was observed around the Northern Channel Islands (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-region-main}). 

While `r spp` have not been encountered is large numbers similar to some of the other commonly encountered species (vermilion/sunset, bocaccio, greenspotted rockfish) in the `r hkl`, `r spp` has been observed every year that the survey has been conducted (Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-pos-year}). Observations of `r spp` commonly occur across a range of depths between 30 - 120 m with observations peaking around 80 m (Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-pos-depth} and Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-depth}). The STAT explored alternative model structures to generate a standardized index of relative abundance. The final model selected was a model with a delta-lognormal model with factors of year, region, drop,  covariates of number of vermilion and bocaccio observed, year region interaction, and with random site effects. A single index of abundance was calculated using all observations from this survey (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-index-main}). Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes and model selection can be found in the Appendix Section \ref{nwfsc-hkl-model}.

#### Composition Data 
\

`r Spp` caught in the `r hkl` were generally between 30 and 50 cm for both sexes (Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-site-len} and \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The number of lengths and ages collected by the survey are shown in Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-samples} and the length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-len-age}. The mean length observed by year was variable with an appreciable drop in the mean size observed in 2012 but has gradually increased in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}).
