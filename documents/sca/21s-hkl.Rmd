### Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook and Line

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure XX) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the `r hkl` are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008]. 

`r Spp` have been observed at multiple sampling sites by the `r hkl` each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table XX).  Starting in 2014 the `r hkl` added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA). Across all sample years and sample sites the `r hkl`  has observed a total of XXX `r spp`.  `r Spp` have been observed both outside and inside the CCA (Figures XXX and XXX).  However, the limited number of `r spp` observations within the CCA constrained the ability to determine whether the CCA impacted the frequency and or sizes observed compared to the other areas sampled (non-CCA sampling sites). `r Spp` were observed at sites with depth ranging between 40 - 120 m with only the largest sizes being observed at the greatest depths (Figure XXX).
