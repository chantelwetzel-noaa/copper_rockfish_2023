	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

We evaluated weight–length relationships and size-at-age using von Bertalanffy growth models for greenstriped rockﬁsh sampled along the U.S. west coast from 2003 to 2008. Based on regression analyses, populations were subdivided into two depth strata (55–122 m and 122–450 m) and four geographic regions (48◦10 N–48◦28 N, 40◦26 N–48◦10 N, 34◦27 N–40◦26 N, and 32◦30 N–34◦27 N) and differences in length, age, and growth examined by gender. Strong evidence of variation in weight–length relationships was found north and south of Cape Mendocino (40◦26 N) but little variation was noted for depth or gender. In contrast, variations in von Bertalanffy growth models were highly dimorphic between sexes with consistent patterns across depth and geographic regions. Females grew more slowly and reached larger asymptotic sizes (L∞, cm) relative to males in all regions examined. Asymptotic size for both males and females tended to increase at higher latitude and increased depth. However, the smallest asymptotic sizes occurred in the region from Pt. Conception to Cape Mendocino, CA (34◦27 N–40◦26 N), rather than lower latitudes south of Pt. Conception (32◦30 N–34◦27 N). Greenstriped rockﬁsh growth coefﬁcients (k, yr−1) exhibited a more complex pattern. Higher growth coefﬁcients were associated with regions within the northern California Current System characterized by high productivity.},

	abstract = {Natural morality (M) is a notoriously difficult population parameter to estimate, yet it is also one of the most important measures of life history that sets, as Beverton and Holt called it, "the course of events". Stock as­ sessments that include this parameter often show great sensitivity to its value, reflecting the need to characetrize the uncertainty inherent in its estimation. Direct measurement of natural mortality is often limited to resource intensive tag-recapture studies. Indirect measures are more often used, and are built on life history theory, relating natural mortality to traits such as age, size, maturity and reproductive condition (or just assuming 0.2). The Natural Mortality Tool attempts to accumulate several empirical estimators of M into one application. Users simply input life history values to obtain estimates of natural mortality. These estimates can be taken individ­ ually or can be combined into a weighted density function that can be used to develop an M prior that integrates uncertainty across several estimates. Comparing estimators can also reveal inconsistencies in life history values that may lead to further refining of basic biological understanding. Two examples are used to demonstrate tool functionality and highlight general recommendations on implementation. Making these estimators and the development of uncertainty in estimating natural mortality more widely available hopefully supports transparent and defensible decision-making on the treatment of this important population parameter.},

	abstract = {The Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires active management of all stocks at risk of overﬁshing or otherwise in need of conservation and management. In the Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council groundﬁsh ﬁshery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help deﬁne stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments deﬁned a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to ﬁsheries. This work uses productivity–susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundﬁsh stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by ﬁrst using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and ﬂexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stockand complex-speciﬁc management.},

	abstract = {The copper rockfish is a benthic, nonmigratory, temperate rocky reef marine species with pelagic larvae and juveniles. A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly–spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, CA, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale ({\textasciitilde}2200 km), significant population subdivision (FST = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections ({\textasciitilde}450 km, FST = 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (Nem) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.},

	abstract = {In order to better assess the ecological importance of offshore petroleum platforms for economically important groundfishes, we quantified the degree of site fidelity of 100 platform-associated individuals representing 15 species at three offshore platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel by means of acoustic telemetry monitoring. Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range ¼ 5–15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs.},

	abstract = {The estimation of home range size of marine fish has received attention because of its application to the design of marine reserves. How individuals use space may also be important to the management of the species and for understanding behavioral processes like optimal foraging or territoriality. We used an acoustic tracking system (VRAP) to examine patterns in home range size and movement behavior for 3 demersal fishes in Puget Sound: lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Data were collected over 8 wk in the summer of 2006 and 3 wk in the winter of 2007. Home ranges were relatively small ({\textasciitilde}1500 to 2500 m2) and did not differ among species. During the summer, lingcod had larger home ranges during the day than at night. Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern. Similar results were seen for quillback rockfish. While the arena of resource management often requires us to simplify complex systems, our results illustrate that such simplification may be difficult, and will depend ultimately on detailed behavioral data.},

Adults are commonly distributed in temperate coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from British Columbia to southern California, including the inland waterways of Puget Sound, Washington, a semi-enclosed fjord system of known postglacial origin. Here, we report the distribution of genetic variation at six microsatellite DNA loci from six locations throughout the species’ range. Among four coastal samples, significant population subdivision was detected (FST = 0.007), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed. Divergence was large and significant between Puget Sound proper and coastal samples (FST = 0.087). A sample taken only 100 km north of Puget Sound (the Canadian Gulf Islands) was also highly divergent from Puget Sound and coastal samples and was genetically intermediate between the two. The Puget Sound sample also displayed significantly lower allelic diversity and a more substantial presence of private alleles. The patterns of genetic divergence and diversity are most consistent with a historical colonization followed by limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations.},

	abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys are an important source of information for stock assessment and management worldwide. Research surveys often use trawl gear to capture commercially valuable species and calculate indices of relative abundance or density. However, many species of interest do not occur in direct contact with the bottom, or occur in areas where high-relief habitat precludes trawl operation. This paper introduces a standardized hook and line survey for rockﬁsh conducted by NOAA Fisheries’ Northwest Fisheries Science Center in the Southern California Bight. The survey uses ﬁshing gear similar to that used in many recreational ﬁsheries to sample approximately 120 locations covering a wide range of depths and habitats. To provide an example of how these data can be analyzed for direct inclusion in stock assessments, we standardize catch rates of bocaccio rockﬁsh from 2004–2008 using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model to account for site, ﬁshing time, survey vessel, angler, and other statistically signiﬁcant effects. Results indicate that the bocaccio stock vulnerable to this survey in the Southern California Bight has shown a relatively ﬂat trend over recent years. Length frequency distributions indicate the presence of several strong cohorts that should be detectable in future stock assessments of bocaccio for use in U.S. West Coast groundﬁsh management. This survey is the only available tuning index for the adult portion of the bocaccio population in recent years as historically used recreational catch per unit effort indices have been compromised due to changes in bag limits and other management restrictions.

However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of ‘true’ population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at ﬁner area scales deﬁned by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly deﬁning management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs.},

	abstract = {Ignoring spatial population structure in the development of ﬁsheries management advice can aﬀect population resilience and yield. However, the resources required to develop spatial stock assessment models that match the spatial scale of management are often unavailable. As a result, quota recommendations from spatially aggregated assessment models are commonly divided among management areas based on empirical methods. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to 1) explore how variation in population structure inﬂuences the spatial distribution of harvest that produces maximum system yield, and 2) contrast the performance of empirical quota allocation methods in approximating ideal spatial harvest strategies. Spatial scenarios that included post-recruitment movement resulted in a broader range of spatial management options (e.g., setting regional total allowable catch) that achieved near maximum system yield compared to scenarios without movement. Stochastic projections showed that using the proportion of total survey biomass in each management area to spatially allocate quota performed best for maximizing system yield when the true spatial structure was unknown, considerably outperforming equal allocation and allocation based on a recruitment index. However, with all methods, area-speciﬁc harvest rates sometimes led to unintended depletion within management units. Improved data and understanding of spatial stock dynamics can reduce the need for ad hoc approaches for spatial harvest allocation, allow for a greater range of management options, and increase the eﬃcacy of spatial management procedures.},

	abstract = {Some ﬁsh stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in ﬁsh biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while ﬁshing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment conﬁgurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of ﬁshery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting ﬁshery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for ﬁshed areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.},

Results highlight the importance of aligning management assessment areas with underlying population structure and processes, especially when ﬁshing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogenous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments (PSs) compared to assessments that cover a subset of a PS, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between PSs. Directed studies and due consideration of critical PSs, spatially explicit models, and dynamic management options that help align management and population boundaries would likely reduce estimation biases and management risk, as would closely coordinated management that functions across population boundaries.},

We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study.

Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winterspawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014–2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events. Species association patterns of pelagic YOY for over 20 rockfish taxa in space and time are also described.

            Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them. Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size (L∞), with L∞ increasing from south to north. This cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific case of the widely described Bergmann’s rule, and we explore specific potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.},

We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered ‘populations’. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high (∼100\%; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H0: Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm ≤ 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm ≤ 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.

We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package’s use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.

                  glm()
                  , lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).
                
              
              
                We hope that sdmTMB’s user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

	abstract = {A study was designed to test whether habitat association affects the movement patterns and habitat preferences of copper, quillback, and brown rockfishes. Resighting of tagged rockfishes (512 tagged rockfishes and 726 resightings) from July 1986 through June 1988 indicated that home ranges, movements from reefs, and tendency to return from experimental displacement (up to 8.0 km) were significantly different on the three habitat types compared. On high relief rocky reefs, rockfishes maintained small home ranges (most within 30 m2) and displayed strong reef fidelity that was not affected by season; no off-reef movement was detected and rockfishes generally returned from displacements. On artificial reefs, rockfishes also maintained small home ranges (most within 30 m2), however, there were pronounced seasonal habitat preferences. In the summer, artificial reefs become less suitable; considerable off-reef movement occurred and rockfish did not return from displacements. In contrast, during fall and winter, rockfishes remained on artificial reefs and returned from displacements. On low relief rocky reefs, rockfishes maintained considerably larger home ranges (most within 400 m2 and some up to 1500 m2) and habitat use was strongly affected by season; rockfishes only inhabited low relief reefs in the summer and only returned from displacements in the summer coincident when peak algal cover. In addition, there was substantial movement between artificial reefs and adjacent low relief reefs; many rockfishes leave artificial reefs in the summer, move to low relief reefs, and return to artificial reefs in the fall when kelp disappears on low relief reefs. Through habitat assessment, movement in response to habitat quality, and ability to home, these rockfish maintain a flexible behavior for optimal habitat use. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Moreover, early life history information is sparse for many species. We used data from 14 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of young-of-the-year Pacific ocean perch collected during 1998–2003 from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. Broad-scale geographic variation in genetic structure of the young-of-the-year (FST = 0.005, P {\textbackslash}textless 10−4) had similarities to that observed in a previous adult study. The overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation by distance) was nearly identical to that observed in the adults. Fine-scale geographic divergence was also observed and may be the result of oceanographic circulation features within the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variation (between cohorts) at locations sampled in more than one year is consistent with variable oceanography and fine-scale population structure rather than the influence of a sweepstakes effect. The similarities of the young-of-the-year with the adults and the pattern of genetic divergence confirm that dispersal of Pacific ocean perch is limited in all life stages.},

	abstract = {A major clam fishery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5–3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys.},

The age-based process caused bias in the estimates of growth parameters assuming random at length, even when relatively few age classes were affected. Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated. Inclusion of paired observations of length and associated age inside the population dynamics model may be the most appropriate way of estimating growth.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fishres.2018.03.014},
	abstract = {Theoretical and applied research suggests that survival rates during early life stages will increase when spawning biomass is reduced in marine fishes (termed 'recruitment compensation'). However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally difficult to estimate for individual fish stocks, and its average value for marine fishes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., five biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing efforts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Specifically, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockfish increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textbackslash}textless 0.6) to 2011 (average: {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockfish rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockfishes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly influenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the bias variance tradeoff between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of difficult-to-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-specification of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {As petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) is a valuable groundfish harvested in the California Current, proper ageing is important for its assessment and management. This study presents the first bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the California Current and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their first year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species specific when possible.},

Sablefish recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sablefish feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sablefish productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sablefish recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sablefish recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sablefish stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to fishery closures.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatiotemporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from prespawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment., An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources., The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime., In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore., More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a 'common currency' for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and 'design principles' for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves 'species ordination' of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a 'common currency' approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

These patterns are an insidious problem, and can lead to severe errors when providing management advice. Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s r (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn’s r tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s r differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn’s r is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn’s r which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of US west coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step towards developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age 1-fish. First, a conceptual life-history approach is used to generate life stage- and spatio-temporally-specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female-spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40-48 °N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (1) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (2) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (3) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (4) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

In this analysis, the reproductive strategy for this species was revisited, fecundity estimates were updated, and size-d­ependent fecundity relationships were established from fish collected off California and the Pacific Northwest. Results of histological analysis indicate that petrale sole exhibit a determinate batch spawning strategy, with potential annual fecundity (PAF) set prior to the release of eggs over the course of several spawning events. Both PAF and relative PAF (weight-s­ pecific fecundity) increased significantly with maternal length and weight. Regional differences in the strength of the relationship between relative PAF and size indicate that the maternal effect is stronger in the Pacific Northwest; however, more data are necessary to confirm regional patterns. Because reproductive output was not proportionate with female size, fisheries managers should consider using relative PAF in determining the reproductive potential of this stock.},

Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 72: 204–216.) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L∞, and CVL∞). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries.},

A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly–spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, CA, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde2200 km), significant population subdivision (FST = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde450 km, FST = 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (Nem) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is often seen as a major conservation issue, potentially threatening endangered species and decreasing biodiversity. In natural populations, the conservation implications of hybridization depends on both on anthropogenic factors and the evolutionary processes maintaining the hybrid zone. However, the timeline and patterns of hybridization in the hybrid zone are often not known. Therefore, species conservation becomes a concern when recent anthropogenic changes influence hybridization and not if hybridization is part of a long-term process. Here, we use sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, three nuclear introns and one nuclear exon to estimate the direction, geographic extent, frequency and possible timeline of hybridization between three rockfish species (Sebastes auriculatus, S. caurinus, S. maliger) in the Salish Sea, Washington, USA. We show that (i) introgression occurred much more frequently in the Salish Sea than on the outer coast, (ii) introgression was highly asymmetrical from S. maliger into the other two species, (iii) almost 40\% of individuals in the Salish Sea were hybrids, with frequency of hybrids increasing with isolation from the coast, and (iv) all hybrids were later generation backcrosses rather than F1 hybrids. Our results suggest long-standing lowlevel hybridization rather than recent onset of interbreeding because of human induced environmental change, possibly facilitated by specific environmental conditions in the sub-basins of the Salish Sea, and by differences in population sizes during recolonization of the area after the last glaciation. This rockfish hybrid system, with asymmetrical introgression and the maintenance of parental species, may prove useful to study both mechanisms that maintain species boundaries and that facilitate speciation in the presence of rapid environmental change.},

We analysed otolith microstructure to determine parturition and settlement dates, pelagic durations, and preand postsettlement growth rates. High CQB rockﬁsh recruitment in 2005 was associated with prolonged downwelling and warm ocean temperatures, late parturition dates, fast presettlement growth, short pelagic durations, and small size-at-settlement. In contrast, high black rockﬁsh recruitment in 2006 was associated with strong upwelling and cool ocean temperatures, slow presettlement growth, and protracted pelagic durations. Presettlement growth of both rockﬁsh complexes increased with high sea surface temperature, but was unrelated to chlorophyll a concentration. Our results indicate that the same oceanographic conditions give rise to fast presettlement growth and short pelagic durations for both groups, but that different factors lead to strong recruitment in each.},

	abstract = {During the past century, commercial fisheries have expanded from small vessels fishing in shallow, coastal habitats to a broad suite of vessels and gears that fish virtually every marine habitat on the globe. Understanding how fisheries have developed in space and time is critical for interpreting and managing the response of ecosystems to the effects of fishing, however time series of spatially explicit data are typically rare. Recently, the 1933–1968 portion of the commercial catch dataset from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife was recovered and digitized, completing the full historical series for both commercial and recreational datasets from 1933–2010. These unique datasets include landing estimates at a coarse 10 by 10 minute ‘‘grid-block’’ spatial resolution and extends the entire length of coastal California up to 180 kilometers from shore. In this study, we focus on the catch history of groundfish which were mapped for each grid-block using the year at 50\% cumulative catch and total historical catch per habitat area. We then constructed generalized linear models to quantify the relationship between spatiotemporal trends in groundfish catches, distance from ports, depth, percentage of days with wind speed over 15 knots, SST and ocean productivity. Our results indicate that over the history of these fisheries, catches have taken place in increasingly deeper habitat, at a greater distance from ports, and in increasingly inclement weather conditions. Understanding spatial development of groundfish fisheries and catches in California are critical for improving population models and for evaluating whether implicit stock assessment model assumptions of relative homogeneity of fisheries removals over time and space are reasonable. This newly reconstructed catch dataset and analysis provides a comprehensive appreciation for the development of groundfish fisheries with respect to commonly assumed trends of global fisheries patterns that are typically constrained by a lack of long-term spatial datasets.},

However, it is quite difficult to estimate given its correlation with other parameters, variation in processes governing population dynamics and data acquisition, as well as other factors such as ageing error. Meta-analytical approaches relating M to other life history parameters are often used to provide an estimate and/or Bayesian prior for M. Longevity is the one of these life history parameters most directly related to M. The maximum observed or estimated age serves as a proxy for longevity in predicting, or developing a prior for, M to be used within a stock assessment or other population model. Consideration of the age data and factors that might influence its quality for deter­ mining a maximum age is important in using a meta-analytically derived relationship between maximum age and M, though these factors are not completely absent from the data used to develop that relationship. Here, we discuss these issues, propose a relationship between maximum age and M, and develop an updated prior for M based upon maximum age.},

	abstract = {In Puget Sound, WA (USA), rockfish (Sebastes spp.) have significantly declined in abundance, with multiple petitions to list individual species under the Endangered Species Act. In order to better understand the ecological legacy of rockfish fishing to the Puget Sound ecosystem, the local history of rockfish exploitation was reviewed, focusing on the socioeconomic forces and management decisions which influenced the trajectory of landings. Rockfish have always been harvested for human consumption in the region, but over time exploitation patterns have changed from an opportunistic subsistence activity by indigenous peoples, to a year-round target of commercial and recreational interests. Annual commercial and recreational harvests together peaked (almost 400. mt) in the early 1980s as anglers' attitudes changed, gear technology improved, rockfish became more familiar to the market, human population increased, and agency programs promoted fisheries to sustain employment. Rockfishes were generally not managed intensely or with conservation goals in mind until the late 1980s, in part due to scientific shortcomings and a lack of resources. By the time management actions were deemed necessary, the greatest harvest had already occurred. However, the low intrinsic productivity of most rockfish species suggests that the legacy of fishing will remain for years to come. As managers strive to restore the integrity and resilience of Puget Sound, they must realize the significance of historical fishery removals to the ecosystem and use the proper social and economic incentives to drive individual behavior toward these ecosystem goals. © 2010.},

	abstract = {Variability in larval supply introduces uncertainty into the management of marine fisheries. This variability can confound short-term population projections of both traditional and spatially explicit models of fishery productivity. A potential remedy is the use of physical oceanographic variables, such as an upwelling index or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, as proxies for recruitment year class strength. We describe a method for incorporating proxy information into population models for fishery management. Our model of a conventional fishery (using kelp rockfish as an example) suggested that proxies were effective in predicting actual larval survival if there was a strong correlation between the proxy and larval survival (r {\textgreater} 0.8), when recruitment was highly variable. Model outputs were most useful when used to hindcast rather than forecast the population trajectory. A spatial extension of the model for marine protected areas (MPAs) confirmed those results and revealed that 1) larval dispersal distances did not affect the utility of the proxy, and 2) adult home range size influenced whether before:after or inside:outside biomass ratios provided a more effective metric of MPA success. We found that proxies greatly improved model projections over short time scales, but that projections beyond the time needed for recruits to enter the fishery were less effective. This work provides an example of how information about environmental variability affecting recruitment can be incorporated into fishery models to improve management.},

	abstract = {U.S. federal fisheries managers are mandated to obtain optimum yield while preventing overfishing. However, optimum yield is not well defined and the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has often been applied to provide an upper bound for the optimum yield value, but determining the MSY, identifying the relative biomass that produces MSY and the associated fishing rate required (FMSY) is difficult. The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages groundfish stocks off the U.S. west coast, has employed proxy targets in lieu of species-specific estimates of MSY, BMSY, and FMSY. The proxy targets are life history specific, with flatfish stocks managed using a target BPROXY of 0.25 of unfished biomass and a harvest control rule that applies an exploitation rate equal to a spawner-per-recruit harvest rate of F0.30, with a linear reduction of catch to zero if the stock falls below 5\% of unfished biomass (BLIMIT). A management strategy evaluation was performed to explore the performance of the current harvest control rule applied to flatfish stocks to meet management goals, along with alternative harvest control rules that explore varying the values for BPROXY BLIMIT, and FSPR. Each of the harvest control rules explored maintained stocks at or near BPROXY when stock-recruit steepness was 0.85 or greater, with very low probabilities of reducing relative biomass below a minimum stock size threshold (set at 0.50 BPROXY of each harvest control rule). The most aggressive harvest control rule, which applied a BPROXY of 0.20 and a target harvest rate of F0.25, led to fishing rates that exceeded the operating model FMSY values for low steepness (0.75), reducing the stock below BPROXY with catches exceeding MSY. Trade-offs exist among alternative harvest control rules where the more aggressive harvest control rules resulted in higher average catches, but with an increase in the average annual variation in catches and a decrease probability of the relative biomass being with 10\% of the BPROXY. The trade-offs among the performance metrics and alternative harvest control rules coupled with the risk to the resource across a range of life histories should be carefully considered by fishery managers when selecting a harvest control rule that will meet the goals of management.},

Within areas, maximum numbers of species were caught at intermediate depths — usually 80–139 fath (146–254 m). With rare exceptions, Pacific ocean perch was the predominant rockfish species in the trawl catches throughout the study area, although its relative abundance declined from north to south.Within areas, ocean perch catch rates were usually maximal at intermediate depths — 120–139 fath (220–254 m) in summer and substantially deeper in winter. Juvenile fish usually occupied shallower depths than adults, but were often in the company of large adults. Among areas, summer catch rates were relatively high off southwest Vancouver Island and southeastern Alaska and in the western Gulf of Alaska. Off Vancouver Island, summer catch rates were higher than winter catch rates, particularly for large adults of both sexes. Echo-sounder records indicated schools were frequently unavailable to the on-bottom trawl used in this survey.Ocean perch in the northeast Pacific Ocean were categorized, tentatively, into B.C.- and Gulf-types, whose mutual boundary is Dixon Entrance. Separation was based on differential size distributions and year-class strengths.Survival rates among year-classes were evidently quite variable, particularly for the Gulf stock west of Cape Spencer.Qualitatively, ocean perch abundance generally increased from south to north in the study area.Bottom-water temperatures varied inversely with depth and latitude. Among areas, temperature range at depths of maximal ocean perch catch rate was 4.5–7.7 C, but in high-abundance areas the temperatures did not exceed 6.0 C. Seasonally, temperature at depths of maximal catch rate varied approximately 1.5 C.},

In addition, widely available software allows for fitting these models and for elaboration of them to learn about the effects of additional factors such as temperature, species interactions, management practices, the introduction of an invasive species, or other known environmental variables. Finally, we provide a connection with the more usual modeling of size-attained data through the use of growth functions such as the von Bertalanffy.},

We advanced beyond presence/absence and presence only models to create predictive maps of fish density (100 m-2) and biomass (kg 100 m-2) for Sebastes rosaceus (rosy rockfish) and S. constellatus (starry rockfish), both common species in commercial and recreational fisheries along the central coast of California.

For all 4 species, broader size ranges and greater proportions of small fish were present in the data from the submersible surveys, and length distributions were significantly different (P{\textless}0.01) in comparisons of all lengths from the submersible surveys with all lengths from the trawl surveys, as well as in comparisons of lengths from the submersible surveys and trawl surveys over trawlable habitat. For 3 species, length distributions were significantly different in comparisons of lengths obtained from submersible surveys on trawlable and on untrawlable habitats. Trawl selectivity curves from recent stock assessments were evaluated in relation to the length data for greenspotted, greenstriped, and canary rockfish. Although derived from a larger spatiotemporal extent than our study, greenspotted and greenstriped rockfish selectivity curves appear to account for the reduced frequency of small fish in the trawl survey, whereas the canary rockfish selectivity curve does not. Similar comparisons between submersible and trawl-survey rockfish lengths from other regions of the west coast could help address spatial variability in trawl survey selectivity and further inform selectivity functions for stock assessments.},

	abstract = {Populations of many nearshore marine species are connected through the dispersal of their larvae. In this paper, larval connectivity patterns in the Southern California Bight are explored using 2 quantities: potential and realized larval connectivity. Potential connectivity is defined as the probability of larval transport from a source to a destination location and is quantified using Lagrangian particle simulations. Realized connectivity is the product of potential connectivity with larval production and can be used to estimate larval settlement patterns. Potential and realized connectivity patterns are quantified for kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus, kelp rockfish Sebastes atrovirens, and red abalone Haliotis rufescens, 3 species with a range of larval dispersal characteristics. Connectivity patterns were found to be both heterogeneous, with locations having different source and destination strengths, and asymmetric, with directionality in larval transport. Both potential and realized connectivity were strongly influenced by the length and timing of the spawning season as well as planktonic larval duration. For kelp bass and kelp rockfish, a strong correspondence was found between realized and potential destination locations, suggesting that circulation processes have a dominant role in shaping the spatial distribution of these 2 species. Strong temporal variability in realized larval connectivity was observed on seasonal and inter-annual time scales (particularly between El Niño and La Niña conditions).

Many benefits result from working together, including (1) the incorporation of fishers’ knowledge and expertise into the management process and (2) the development of shared perspectives derived through science-based investigations on the status of marine resources. The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program was formed in 2006 to participate in the monitoring of marine reserves established through California’s Marine Life Protection Act.

	abstract = {A major clam fishery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5-3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Conservative assessments (low biomass estimates for which there is only a small probability that biomass is actually lower) are favored during development when loss is measured as the relative departure from the best quota for each year. But if loss is measured as absolute departure from the best quota, it is generally better to base the quota on the biomass estimate for which there is nearly a 50\% chance that the stock is smaller. Deliberate overfishing (probing) is not favored under either loss measure. Losses can be reduced with minimum biomass surveys and closed areas that directly cushion fishing mortality rates from being more than 50\% too low or high.},

Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following Severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research, and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development.},

Short-term impacts with experimental cod ends were analyzed. Six cod ends were used as treatments: 76-, 114-, 127-, and 140-mm diamond mesh, and 114- and 127-mm square mesh. Three response variables were used to compare these cod ends: utilized catch weight (weight of marketable-sized fish), size-discard catch weight (weight of fish discarded due to small size), and giller weight (weight of fish wedged between meshes). Species composition differed between the “inner nearshore” area (0–91 m depth) and the “outer nearshore” area ({\textgreater}91–183 m depth). For all cod ends, the inner nearshore had a consistently greater percent total discard than the outer nearshore. The individual cod end results showed that the 76-mm diamond gave excessively high size-discard rates for both areas. The 114-mm square mesh performed well in the outer nearshore, giving high utilized weight per hour and low size-discard weight per hour. The 114-mm diamond mesh did better in the inner nearshore, where a larger percentage of flatfish were utilized, giving a reasonable utilized weight per hour and also a low size-discard weight per hour. © 1996 American Fisheries Society.},

The model demonstrates that modest dispersal rates of older fish can substantially reduce abundance within protected areas compared with predictions from models that ignore such dispersal. The strength of compensatory improvements in postsettlement juvenile survival is the most critical factor in determining whether a reserve network can rescue populations from the impacts of severe overharvesting. We use the model to compare specific alternative proposals for protected area networks along the California coast, as mandated through California's Marine Life Protection Act, and show that achieving the goals of the Act depends primarily on the fisheries management regulations outside of protected areas and that the size and configuration of MPAs has little impact. © 2007 NRC.},

	abstract = {A multispecies spatial model is proposed for evaluation of trawl management strategies and tested with data from British Columbia grounfish. Minimum stock sizes are estimated for 16 species using spatial catch per unit effort data; these data indicate that only small proportions of most stocks are exposed to fishing at any time and that exchange rates of fish between the grounds and other habitats are rapid. A gravity model for spatial effort allocation predicts substantial side effects of marine protected areas of discarding of particular species on nontarget species/grounds due to redistribution of fishing effort. Multispecies, multiground delay-difference models are used in conjunction with the gravity model for spatial effort distribution to predict long-term population responses to various regulatory strategies. This simulation suggests that species composition and spatial structure of the fishery are changing slowly due to reduction in abundance of long-lived species, but rapid collapses of target stocks are unlikely due to spatial redistribution of effort in response to local declines. We question quota management (individual vessel quotas) can be safely implemented due to extreme uncertainty about current stock sizes and suggest that a better strategy may be to simply denominate fishing rights as individual effort quotas while providing protection for sensitive stocks through carefully placed marine protected areas.},

How individuals use space may also be important to the management of the species and for understanding behavioral processes like optimal foraging or territoriality. We used an acoustic tracking system (VRAP) to examine patterns in home range size and movement behavior for 3 demersal fishes in Puget Sound: lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Data were collected over 8 wk in the summer of 2006 and 3 wk in the winter of 2007. Home ranges were relatively small (∼1500 to 2500 m2) and did not differ among species. During the summer, lingcod had larger home ranges during the day than at night. Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern. Similar results were seen for quillback rockfish. While the arena of resource management often requires us to simplify complex systems, our results illustrate that such simplification may be difficult, and will depend ultimately on detailed behavioral data. © Inter-Research 2009.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear ("catchability"). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels ("vessel effects"), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time ("vessel-year effects") can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

	abstract = {Scientific survey data are used to estimate abundance trends for fish populations worldwide, and are frequently analyzed using delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMMs). Delta-GLMMs incorporate information about both the probability of catch being non-zero (catch probability) and the expected value for non-zero catches (catch rates). Delta-GLMMs generally incorporate year as a main effect, and frequently account for spatial strata and/or covariates. Many existing delta-GLMMs do not account for random or systematic differences in catch probability or rates in particular combinations of spatial strata and year (i.e., space-time interactions), and do not recognize potential correlation in random space-time interactions between catch probability and catch rates. We therefore develop a Bayesian delta-GLMM that estimates correlations between catch probability and rates, and compare it with either (a) ignoring year-strata interactions, (b) modeling year-strata interactions as fixed effects, or (c) estimating year-strata interactions in catch probability or rates as independent random effects. These four models are fitted to bottom trawl survey data for 28 species off the U.S. West Coast. The posterior median of the correlation is positive for the majority (18) of species, including all five for which the posterior distribution has little overlap with zero. However, estimating this correlation has little impact on resulting abundance indices or credible intervals. We therefore conclude that the correlated random model will have a little impact on index standardization of the West Coast bottom trawl dataset. However, we propose that the correlated model can quickly identify correlations between occupancy probability and density, and provide our code to allow researchers to quickly identify whether such a correlation is likely to be significantly different from zero for their chosen data set. © 2013.},

Finally, mixed-effects modeling was applied to multispecies data to evaluate the hypothesis that ECEs are related to shoaling behaviors. Results show that mixture distribution models are often selected over conventional models for shoaling species and that untrawlable habitat has a positive effect on rockfish densities. Simulation shows that mixture distribution models can perform as well as or better than conventional models at predicting positive catch rates. Finally, model selection supports the hypothesis that shoaling behaviors contribute to the occurrence of ECEs. We propose that greater understanding of ECEs and shoaling habitat selection could be useful in future spatial management and survey design and that mixture distribution models could improve methods for estimating annual indices of abundance.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

Next, we use meta-analysis to estimate effort dynamics for US West Coast groundfishes before and after fisheries management changes in the mid-1990s. We apply the SSCOM using meta-analytic results to data for eight assessed species and compare results with stock assessment and data-poor methods.

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

In southern California, oceanographic conditions vary widely from east to west as the offshore region is impacted by cool, southern flowing California Current water, while the inshore is typically warmer and more productive. We investigated how patterns of distribution and abundance of larval, genetically identified rockfishes related to environmental conditions off southern California, the world's center of rockfish Sebastes spp. species diversity. The rockfish assemblage was dominated by small and short-lived species not typically targeted by recreational or commercial fishing (i.e. shortbelly S. jordani and squarespot S. hopkinsi rockfishes), but also contained moderate abundances of a few larger, targeted species (bank S. rufus and bocaccio S. paucispinis rockfishes). Spawning locations of many species were affected by environmental variability, as abundances of young (0 to 2 d old), targeted larvae were mainly found offshore in the cool, low primary production waters that also were relatively shallow and contained hard substrate. In contrast, untargeted species were more widespread and correlated positively only with hard substrate. Hotspots of species richness and targeted species were high within a large managed region, the Cowcod Conservation Area, indicating that it is effectively protecting important rockfish spawning habitat. This research highlights the need to account for environmental variation in habitat and assemblage structure when conducting marine spatial planning.},

We therefore incorporate the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution into Stock Synthesis, and propose it as a model-based method for estimating effective sample size. This distribution incorporates one additional parameter per fleet (with the option of mirroring its value among fleets), and we show that this parameter governs the ratio of nominal (“input”) and effective (“output”) sample size. We demonstrate this approach using data for Pacific hake, where the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and an iterative reweighting approach previously developed by McAllister and Ianelli (1997) give similar results. We also use simulation testing to explore the estimation properties of this new estimator, and show that it provides approximately unbiased estimates of variance inflation when compositional samples capture clusters of individuals with similar ages/lengths.

However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally difficult to estimate for individual fish stocks, and its average value for marine fishes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., five biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing efforts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Specifically, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockfish increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textless}0.6) to 2011 (average:{\textgreater}0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockfish rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockfishes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly influenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the bias-variance tradeoff between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of difficult-to-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-specification of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. "joint species distribution" or "multispecies occupancy" models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed "biogenic habitat") improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Understanding the life history of these species is a critical first step in developing management strategies to protect them from overharvest. In this study we employ cross-dating methods to validate the annual periodicity of growth increments and investigate the age, growth and maturity of aurora rockfish, a species for which life history information is quite limited. Specimens were collected on an opportunistic basis from Oregon commercial landings and from research cruises, over the years 2003-2006. Age was estimated for 438 individuals using otoliths processed via the break-and-burn method. The maximum estimated age was 118 years for females (n=324) and 81 years for males (n=114). The von Bertalanffy growth function showed that males grow faster and reach a smaller maximum size than females (males: Linf =34, K=0.09, t0=-1.9; females: Linf=37, K=0.06, t0=-5.5), though both sexes demonstrate relatively slow growth. Visual assessment of ovaries showed that the aurora rockfish is a synchronous spawner with parturition occurring in May and June off Oregon. Female age and length at 50\% maturity were calculated at 12.6 years and 26 cm, respectively (n=307). Maturity and age data provided evidence for a protracted adolescence in this species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) can facilitate recovery of diminished stocks by protecting reproductive adults. To effectively augment fisheries, however, reproductive output must increase within the bounds of MPAs so that larvae can be exported to surrounding areas and seed the region. In response to dramatic declines of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) in southern California by the late 1990s two large MPAs, the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs), were established in 2001. To evaluate whether the CCAs affected rockfish productivity we evaluated the dynamics of 8 species that were, and 7 that were not, historically targeted by fishing. Abundances of 6/8 targeted and 4/7 non-targeted species increased regionally from 1998 to 2013. These upturns were probably affected by environmental conditions in addition to changes in fishing pressure as the presence of most species correlated negatively with temperature, and temperature was lower than the historic average in 11/15 years. Seventy-five per cent of the targeted, but none of the non-targeted species increased at a greater rate inside than outside the CCAs while controlling for environmental factors. Results indicate that management actions, coupled with favourable environmental conditions, facilitated the resurgence of multiple rockfish species that were targeted by intense fishing effort for decades.},

To do this, we sampled forage fish communities using a seabird predator, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), at six coastal study sites from Japan to California. We investigated whether take of forage fishes was related to local marine conditions as indexed by sea surface temperature (SST). SST was concordant across sites in the eastern Pacific, but inversely correlated between east and west. Forage fish communities consisted of anchovy (Engraulis spp.), sandlance (Ammodytes spp.), capelin (Mallotus spp.), and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.), among others, and take of forage fish varied in response to interannual and possibly lower-frequency oceanographic variability. Take of primary forage species were significantly related to changes in SST only at the eastern sites. We found synchrony in interannual variation of primary forage fishes across several regions in the eastern Pacific, but no significant east-west correlations. Specifically in the Japan Sea, factors other than local SST or interannual variability may more strongly influence forage fishes. Predator diet sampling offers a fishery-independent, large-scale perspective on forage fish dynamics that may be difficult to obtain using conventional means of study. © 2008 NRC.},

The main layer frequently split into three parts with different vertical migration patterns. At dawn a layer gradually appeared at about 90 m, intensified rapidly, and descended to the daytime level.Catches show fishes are associated with the sound scattering layers. The largest day catches were from the main layer. At night fish did not appear to be concentrated to the same extent relative to the layers.

Fish with no swim bladders or with fat-filled ones may make longer vertical migrations than those with gas-filled bladders.},

We fit geostatistical delta-models to fisheries observer bycatch data for six species with a broad range of movement patterns (e.g., highly migratory sea turtles versus sedentary rockfish) and bycatch rates (percentage of observations with nonzero catch, 0.3\%–96.2\%). Random forests had better interpolation performance than the GMRF and GAM models for all six species, but random forests performance was more sensitive when predicting data at the edge of the fishery (i.e., spatial extrapolation). Using random forests to identify and remove the 5\% highest bycatch risk fishing events reduced the bycatch-to-target species catch ratio by 34\% on average. All models considerably reduced the bycatch-to-target ratio, demonstrating the clear potential of species distribution models to support spatial fishery management.},

	abstract = {Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have historically comprised a large proportion of catches in the nearshore recreational fishery in California, but declining populations of some species have led to increasingly restrictive management of the resource. This report summarizes new and existing data on rockfishes of the south central coast of California. In 2003, the California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo placed observers on commercial passenger fishing vessels (partyboats) from the region. By the end of 2005, we had observed catches from 258 trips (8,839 fisher hours). We appended these data to partyboat catch statistics collected by the California Department of Fish and Game from 1988 to 1998 and calculated annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) and mean sizes by species and year. The CPUE data by species fluctuate annually but rarely show consistent trends. The overall CPUE for 2004 and 2005 ranks in the top five of the twenty sampled years. Mean sizes have been consistent by species, generally just above the size of 50\% maturity. Comparing these sizes to historical data shows decreases in some species but not in others. A review of NOAA/NMFS triennial trawl data for the Point Conception area in the southern part of the study region suggests that the deeper shelf and slope species, with a few exceptions, show little evidence of long-term declines. In general, the south central coast rockfish resources, with the exception of bocaccio (S. paucispinis), have not shown strong evidence of a declining trend over the past 25 years.},

Whether or not movements or changes in behavior affect survey bias is more difficult to assess. A simple conceptual model is presented to evaluate relationships between stimulus intensity, distances from the vehicle where reactions occur, and survey bias. Largest bias is caused by attraction or avoidance that occurs outside the field of cameras or observers. While light level and vehicle speed have been explored experimentally in a few cases, much remains to be learned about how bias varies among species, age groups, different vehicles, and operating conditions. Given poor understanding of survey bias, we recommend that surveys be conducted with minimum possible variation in operations and that vehicle time is devoted to experimental evaluation of methods. There is no good substitute for direct observations on fish behavior, distribution, and abundance; and survey design can be improved through experimentation. © 2008 NRC.},

Applying this method to length-composition observations for 47 groundfish species collected during a standardized trawl survey, we found maximum realized sample size to be related to both the number of hauls and individual fish sampled from those hauls. Sampling in excess of 20 fish from each haul produced little increase in most cases, with maximum realized sample size ranging from approximately 2 to 4 per haul sampled. Utilizing these maximum realized sample sizes as input values for stock assessment (analogous to minimum variance estimates) appropriately incorporates interannual variability, and may reduce over-emphasis on composition data.

Intraspecific genetic variability is appreciable, with most individuals having unique haplotypes. Gene flow is substantial among some locations and others diverged significantly. Genetic divergences among sampling sites for S. alascanus indicate an isolation by geographic distance pattern. Genetic divergences for S. altivelis are unrelated to the hypothesis of isolation by geographic distance and appear to be more consistent with the hypothesis of larval retention in currents and gyres.

Although recruitment variability has been extensively studied, somatic growth variation has received less attention, in part because of difficulties in modeling growth from individual size-at-age estimates. Here we develop a Bayesian state-space approach to test for the prevalence of alternative forms of growth rate variability (e.g., annual, cohort-level, or in the first year recruited to the fishery) in size-at-age data. We apply this technique to 29 Pacific groundfish species across the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea – Aleutian Islands marine ecosystems. About 40\% of modeled stocks were estimated to exhibit temporal growth variation. In the majority of stocks, growth trends fluctuated annually across ages in a single year, suggesting that either there are shared environmental features that dictate growth across multiple ages or the presence of some systematic (within-year) observation errors. This method represents a novel way to use size-at-age data from fishery or other sources to test hypotheses about growth dynamics variability.},

	abstract = {We summarize the life history characteristics of silvergray rockfish (Sebastes brevispinis) based on commercial fishery data and biological samples from British Columbia waters. Silvergray rockfish occupy bottom depths of 100-300 m near the edge of the continental shelf. Within that range, they appear to make a seasonal movement from 100-200 m in late summer to 180-280 m in late winter. Maximum observed age in the data set was 81 and 82 years for females and males, respectively. Maximum length and round weight was 73 cm and 5032 g for females and 70 cm and 3430 g for males. The peak period of mating lasted from December to February and parturition was concentrated from May to July. Both sexes are 50\% mature by 9 or 10 years and 90\% are mature by age 16 for females and age 13 years for males. Fecundity was estimated from one sample of 132 females and ranged from 181,000 to 1,917,000 oocytes and there was no evidence of batch spawning. Infection by the copepod parasite Sarcotaces arcticus appears to be associated with lower fecundity. Sexual maturation appears to precede recruitment to the trawl fishery; thus spawning stock biomass per recruit analysis (SSB/R) indicates that a F50\% harvest target would correspond to an F of 0.072, 20\% greater than M (0.06). Fishery samples may bias estimates of age at maturity but a published meta-data analysis, in conjunction with fecundity data, independently supports an early age of maturity in relation to recruitment. Although delayed recruitment to the fishery may provide more resilience to exploitation, managers may wish to forego maximizing economic yield from this species. Silvergray rockfish are a relatively minor but unavoidable part of the multiple species trawl catch. Incorrectly "testing" the resilience of one species may cause it to be the weakest member of the species complex.},

No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices.

There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year-classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross-shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best-fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmental variables as covariates and there was some consistent response across stocks to these variables. Future research may be able to utilize these across-stock environmental influences, in conjunction with an understanding of ecological processes important across early life history stages, to improve identification of environmental drivers of recruitment. © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We simulated populations based on Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) to explore how estimates of reference points Fmsy and Fcrash are affected by maternal effects and potential interactions with life-history pattern, recruitment autocorrelation, and exploitation rate. Estimates of Fmsy and Fcrash were made from populations with maternal effects using either total larvae (proportional to eggs) or viable larvae (incorporating the maternal effect). Maternal effects have the largest impact upon estimated population productivity at high fishing rates. Estimates of Fmsy and Fcrash for cod were also affected by autocorrelated recruitment variability because of their reduced longevity compared with Pacific ocean perch. These results suggest the importance of evaluating the influence of maternal effects on estimated stock productivity on a case-by-case basis, particularly for depleted stocks composed of relatively young spawners.},

We found distinct spatial differences in the natal elemental signatures in the core region of the otoliths of postdispersal juvenile kelp rockfish Sebastes atrovirens collected along the coast of California, USA. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of individual otolith cores revealed detectable levels of Mn, Mg, Ba, and Sr. Using a Bayesian classification model, 2 unique elemental signature types were identified in both 2001 and 2002, and the signatures were chemically similar across years. In both years, locations received a mixture of natal types ('A' and 'B'), indicating the contribution of at least 2 chemically distinct sources to recruitment. The spatial pattern of the natal types varied among sites for both years. In 2001, Type A was nearly absent from the northernmost location, suggesting a southern origin and a limitation in the dispersal and contribution of this chemically identified natal type. In 2002, most locations had a mix of Types A and B, but Type A was most abundant in the south and least abundant in the central part of the spatial domain. However, it was not possible to specify the full extent of dispersal of either natal type. We demonstrated use of elemental signatures in the otolith core of post-dispersal individuals to evaluate larval dispersal patterns which may document the extent to which kelp rockfish populations along the California coast receive recruits from different chemically distinct sources. © Inter-Research 2011.},

This study examines several management strategies for two marine fish species subject to IBD using simulation: Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the Aleutian Islands (AI) and northern rockfish (Sebastes polyspinis) in the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and AI. A one-dimensional stepping stone model was used to model IBD and was intended to mimic regions where marine species are exploited along a continental shelf. The performance of spatial assessment and management methods depended on how the range was split. Splitting anywhere within the managed area led to fewer demes falling below target and threshold biomass levels and higher yield than managing the entire area as a single unit. Equilibrium yield was maximized when each deme was assessed and managed separately and under catch cascading, in which harvest quotas within a management unit are spatially allocated based upon the distribution of survey biomass. The longer-lived rockfish declined more slowly than Pacific cod and experienced greater depletion in biomass under disproportionate fishing effort because of lower productivity. Overall, splitting a management area of the size simulated in the model improved performance measures, and the optimal management strategy grouped management units by demes with similar relative fishing effort.},

Results are considered in terms of marine fish species in general, and parameters in the model are based on Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region of Alaska. Population dynamics are projected under several management strategies, some of which establish management units based on the results of genetic testing and some that do not.

Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last 60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89\% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21\%) and 1990s (17\%). Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region.

	url = {http://repository.library.csuci.edu/bitstream/handle/10139/956/Ebeling1978Habitat~.pdf?sequence=1},
	abstract = {The islands off southern California diversify the coastal environment by doubling the length of shoreline and extending coastal habitats (Horn 1974). Geologically, and perhaps biologically, these islands may be classified into northern (bordering the Santa Barbara Channel) and southern groups (Hewatt 1946, Valentine and Lipps 1967, Weaver and Doerner 1967). Yet classification of the insular shore fish fauna is more complex. On a broad scale, distributions of shore fishes are influenced by water temperature and associated currents: the cool, southerly-flowing California Current offshore, and the warmer, inshore countercurrent and eddy (Hubbs 1967, 1974, Neushul et al. 1967). Also, the specific assemblage of fishes in a given area will depend very strongly on the habitat structure there. And finally, isolation at islands may be brought about either by differential transport of species having planktonic larvae (Kanter 1980, Seapy and Littler 1980) or by chance transport of species that have no planktonic dispersal stage (cf. Haldorson 1980). Our study analyzes the effects of habitat on the composition of one element of the inshore fish fauna, the kelp-bed Fishes, and applies this analysis to compare the kelp-bed fish assemblages at Santa Cruz Island with those from the adjacent Santa Barbara mainland. Some papers in this symposium dealt with large-scale biogeography of inshore organisms on the California Islands (Seapy and Littler 1980, Silva 1978). Even though we do not address this problem directly, we realize that interpretations of habitat effects must consider geographic affinities of the fauna. On the other hand, habitat effects may confound broad-scale geographic effects (cf. Kanter 1980, Littler 1980). Our objective, therefore, is to show how assemblages of kelp-bed fishes may be classified into particular habitat groups, and how differences in structural habitat affect the composition of fish assemblages making up such groups. We did our study off Santa Barbara, at the southern end of a transitional zone between a warm-temperate biota to the southeast and a cool-temperate biota at San Miguel Island and north of Point Conception (cf. Hewatt 1946, Hubbs 1948, 1960, 1974. Neushul et al. 1967, Quasi 1968b. Ebeling et al. 1971). The mixed composition of the fauna reflects water tempera-lure and exposure to currents. The California Current carries cool water seaward past Point Conception, although a small branch of this current feeds a counterclockwise eddy in the western part of the Santa Barbara Channel (Reid 1965, Kolpack 1971). This eddy meets warmer currents from the southeast at the eastern end of the Channel, near Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz Island (Kolpack 1971). Therefore, even though oceanographically complex, our study areas are warmer and more exposed to southern currents than is San Miguel Island at the western end of the channel. Given the geographic affinities of the fish fauna in our study areas, we investigated the influence of structural habitat on the composition of fish assemblages in and about beds of giantkelp(Macrocystis). In this way, we hoped to explain any "island effect" on these assemblages. as expressed by differences in species abundance and composition between Santa Cruz Island.. and the Santa Barbara mainland. Inshore habitats vary along several environmental gradient (Limbaugh 1955, North 1963, Quast 1968a, Frey 1971). For example, density of giant kelp varies with depth and several other factors (Neushul et al. 1967, North 1963, 1971, Quast 1968a. Pearse and Lowry 1974). A depth-related gradient in dominant plants extends from surfgrass, boa kelp, or Pterygophora-Eisenia communities inshore, through giant kelp and red algae at intermediate depths, to depauperate plant communities in deeper water (Clarke and Neushul 1967, Neushul et al. 1967). Such biotic gradients follow abiotic gradients in temperature, light, wave surge, and productivity (Quast 1968a, Pequegnat 1964). A gradient in substrate type extends from flat and soft bottoms of sand and/or mud, through flat and hard bottoms, to high-relief rocky reefs; the "turf" of sessile animals and plants that covers these reefs varies with degree of water movement, silting, scouring, light penetration, and grazing (McLean 1962, Pequegnat 1964, Turner et al. 1965, 1968, Clarke and Neushul 1967, North 1971, Pearse and Lowry 1974, Neushul et al. 1976). Much like a forest, giant kelp provides a vertical gradient along which animals tend to stratify in the water column. Kelp stipes in midwater and the dense canopy near the surface provide shelter, food, and landmarks for a variety of fishes (Hobson 1965, Quast 1968b, Feder et al. 1974, Alevizon 1976). Limbaugh (1955) and Quast (1968b, 1968c) analyzed kelp-bed fish assemblages mainly in the San Diego area of southern California. Miller and Geibel (1973) and Burge and Schultz (1973) analyzed such assemblages off central California, north of Point Conception. These investigators evaluated specific responses of individual species to their natural environment and were concerned with how assemblages may respond to changes in structural habitat. Excepting a few fragmentary observations and species lists (Hewatt 1946, Clarke and Neushul 1967, Neushul et al. 1967, Quast 1968c), however, there was almost no published information from the Santa Barbara area. We supplement these seminal studies of southern and northern regions by taking a more synthetic approach to analyzing species assemblages in the less well-known transitional region off Santa Barbara. Thus, although we must interpret our results in terms of behavior of particular species, our results provide an overall view of changing fish assemblages. Hopefully, our synecological approach reveals general trends not immediately obvious from autecological studies. We compared kelp-bed fish assemblages sampled at different localities along Santa Cruz Island with assemblages sampled at different localities along the Santa Barbara mainland. We first determined the structure of assemblages by identifying subgroups of species ("habitat groups") that tend to associate with different positions on environmental gradients in and about areas of reef and kelp. We then compared the density, diversity, and composition of assemblages among localities, between mainland and island, and between seasons. With this information, we were better able to distinguish and explain any island effect on the assemblages, in light of the faunal complexity of the region.},

Fishery yield enhancement in areas surrounding refuges occurred in the few studies where yields were examined. The export of propagules required to enhance fisheries in areas surrounding refugia adds a level of complexity to the design of fishery refugia beyond that of terrestrial reserves. Fishery refugia design should consider species life histories, oceanographic regimes, habitat quality, and socioeconomic factors. -from Authors},

	abstract = {Many species of marine fish are found in similar habitats and display similar vulnerability to fishing pressure, although their sustainable exploitation rates may differ considerably. Managing and setting harvest limits is challenging for such co-occurring species because the management targets for the less productive species may affect the fishing opportunities for the more productive species. We used simulation modeling to explore the effects of setting multi-species management targets and harvest regulations at local area or coast-wide levels. Setting management targets over the entire coast, and identifying optimal harvest rates within each local area, consistently led to the same or higher yields than setting management targets for each area. Essentially, the global conservation goal can be achieved by protecting areas in which the less productive species is abundant and by taking most of the harvest from other areas. The increases in yield do not increase the coast-wide probabilities of either species being overfished or severely depleted, but do increase these probabilities at the local area level for the less productive species. These results are magnified with increased spatial variation in the ratio of abundance and differences in intrinsic rates of growth among the fished species.},

Data are frequently aggregated across space in stock assessments, thus disregarding this complex spatial structure and possibly introducing bias into estimates of stock status. An operating model (OM) is created that simulates data that are used in a set of estimation models to assess bias. The following experimental factors are considered: (i) using survey data and environmental indices in the assessment; (ii) using disaggregated data (two regions, as generated by the OM) or aggregated data (one region); and (iii) incorporating different patterns in the OM’s regional exploitation and environmentally driven recruitment distribution.},

	abstract = {Current fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P mat ; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P opt ; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, P mega ) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as P x ) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of P x measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB0]) and limit reference point (0.25SB0) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each P x measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (L mat ) to the optimal fishing length (L opt ). Although the values of P x may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for P x cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P obj (the sum of P mat , P opt , and P mega ), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2009.},

This RE framework also accounts for the effects of selectivity on growth curve estimation by characterizing the distribution of true ages derived from multiple age reads using either an exponential or gamma distribution. Simulation testing across four life histories is used to compare the RE approach with standard nonlinear (SNL) approaches that use the primary, average, or median ages in growth estimation. Sensitivity tests compare the effects of assumed length and ageing error, selectivity, and recruitment variability on the estimation of growth curve parameters. Results support the use of the RE method using a gamma distribution over the SNL methods because RE method estimates of VBGF growth parameters were more precise across life histories and sensitivity trials. This general approach can be applied and expanded to other growth models. Applications demonstrate that the results from RE methods may differ in biologically important ways to those obtained from SNL approaches. © 2007 NRC.},

While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two " Simple Stock Synthesis" (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in " building-up" stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations. © 2012.},

Both species have a seasonally synchronous reproductive cycle with parturition occurring in the late spring to early summer.

Northern rockfish had a rate of total reproductive failure or skipped spawning of 16.3\%, and light dusky rockfish had a total reproductive failure rate of 15.6\%. As light dusky and northern rockfish grow larger throughout their lives, their relative fecundities increase and the likelihood of reproductive failure decreases.

	abstract = {When oil and gas platforms become obsolete they go through a decommissioning process. This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80\% of fish biomass and 86\% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90\% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). "Shell mounds" are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.},

Most previous estimates have come from estuarine environments, generally regarded as one of the most productive ecosystems globally. High rates of fish production on these platformsultimately result fromhigh levels of recruitment and the subsequent growth of primarily rockfish (genus Sebastes) larvae and pelagic juveniles to the substantial amount of complex hardscape habitat created by the platform structure distributed throughout the water column. The platforms have a high ratio of structural surface area to seafloor surface area, resulting in large amounts of habitat for juvenile and adult demersal fishes over a relatively small footprint of seafloor.

California may permit some portion of the structures of offshore oil and gas platforms to remain in place if a "net benefit to the marine environment" can be demonstrated. Here we assess habitats at 23 oil and gas platforms in terms of site- and speciesspecific estimates of potential reproductive output. We identified 17 fish species (15 rockfishes Sebastes spp.) that have potential reproductive output densities (no. eggs m-2) on individual platforms that were tens to hundreds of times their average on natural reefs in the study area, with the highest potential reproductive output values being observed on platforms for all but two of these species. These extreme values were typically observed in platform base habitats, and likely result from the combined effects of high levels of fish recruitment to midwater platform habitats, relatively low fishing activity on these structures, and ontogenetic habitat use (depth-specific) patterns that make some platforms better habitats for some species based on the seafloor depth where they are sited. However, spatial variability was also very high across both platform and natural reef sites, including reproductive potential for almost all focal species being zero at the majority of surveyed sites. The contribution of fish reproductive potential to the discussion of decommissioning alternatives should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis for each platform in California.},

This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. © 2013 The Authors.},

Habitat parameters were calculated from a 20 m resolution bathym-etry layer. Yelloweye and quillback were examined separately and combined with 19 other rockfish species in a species aggregate (total rockfish); occurrence data were fitted with generalized linear mixed effects models, and abundance data were fitted with zero-inflated mixed effects models. The relationship between rockfish abundance with presence–absence and slope, distance to rocky habitat, and fine bathymetric position index suggests that these species prefer rocky, steep habitat. While underwater visual observation data offer measures of visual fish habitat and abundance, longline surveys may be a more cost-effective method for large-scale studies.},

	abstract = {Recruitment variation in marine populations is clearly affected by physical processes in the ocean. We therefore examined correlations between long-term, high-frequency data on fish settlement on artificial substrates and oceanographic processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. We sought, for example, associations with processes occurring close in time and space to settlement events (suggesting processes affecting local delivery) or with those at particular spatial and temporal lags (suggesting influences on larval transport and survival or, at even greater time lags, on larval production). We used as response variables an 8-yr, biweekly record of settlement of three groups of fishes to sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. Predictor variables were day-specific physical processes resolved to "local" scales and then binned and lagged to represent "regional" and "basin" spatial scales and more distant time horizons. We used linear models to assess the amount of variability in settlement associated with variation in processes at different spatial and temporal scales, representing different processes such as food availability or physical transport. We found that settlement is linearly associated with a combination of large-scale factors at long time lags, consistent with variation in production at sources and early larval survivorship, and with small-scale factors at short time lags, consistent with processes aiding delivery of competent individuals to suitable nearshore habitat. Species groups differ in the relative strength of these factors, potentially because of different biological attributes. © 2010 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

In particular, the targeting of the largest and oldest individuals in a stock changes the age and size distribution of that stock. A large female produces a higher quantity of eggs than a young female because of its larger size, but recent laboratory evidence further indicates that large females also produce eggs of higher quality, a phenomenon known as maternal effects. However, most traditional management models assume that all female fish contribute equally per unit biomass to future recruitment. Here we investigate whether this assumption is valid by calculating the impact of maternal effects both before and after accounting for density-dependent effects. We find that the contribution of large individuals to reproduction is much more pronounced for unfished than for fished stocks. Fisheries reference points are largely unaffected by maternal effects. Our results indicate that the incorporation of maternal effects into impact assessments of fisheries is not expected to change advice substantially. Important exceptions are stocks whose demography is very vulnerable to fishing (and which therefore have low fishing reference points) for which maternal effects are relevant and necessary to consider. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.},

In the Salish Sea, a number of MPAs protect several species of rockfish (Sebastes spp.), three of which are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA); however, the role of coastal river otter (Lontra canadensis) predation on rock-fish populations is poorly understood. This study describes the scarcely studied diet of river otters in the San Juan Islands, Washington, as a first step in assessing the potential effect of these preda-tors on rockfish. Using frequency of occurrence (\% FO), we described coastal river otter diet for San Juan, Orcas, and Fidalgo Islands during the summer of 2008. River otters consumed a vari-ety of both fish and invertebrate species. Fish occurred most frequently in their diet at all three islands, including gunnels (Pholidae) (present in 83.6 to 97.3\% of scats), sculpins (Cottidae) (79.5 to 97.3\%), and pricklebacks (Stichaeidae) (58.9 to 78.1\%). Rockfish were present in 2.7 to 21.9\% of river otter scat with the highest occurrence at San Juan Island (21.9\%). Scat also contained a higher occurrence of juvenile rockfish vs adult specimens. Although rockfish consumption by river otters at San Juan Island has increased since the summer of 1999, consistent with the establish-ment of MPAs, we cannot attribute the establish-ment of MPAs as the cause or address the positive or negative potential effects of river otter preda-tion on rockfish recovery.

We investigated whether the juveniles of the 2000 year-class and the adult population were genetically homogeneous along the California coast. We sampled approximately 100 juveniles from three sites, two sites along the Monterey Peninsula (Carmel and Monterey) in central California and one at Fort Ross in northern California, and approximately 50 adult S. mystinus from five sites throughout the population center. The adult sampling spanned approximately 700 km from the northern Channel Islands to Fort Bragg. The juveniles showed significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies among distant locations and genetic homogeneity among adjacent locations. In contrast, the adults showed genetic homogeneity over large distances (San Miguel Island to Fort Bragg), indicating little limitation of gene flow in this region. Allele frequencies of juveniles differed from adult samples and in some cases reduced genetic diversity indicative of sweepstakes recruitment (small sample of the adult reproductive potential). The genetic structure of the 2000 year-class suggests that despite a genetically homogenous adult population, settled juveniles can be genetically heterogeneous along the California coast. The results also suggest that the adults, with several year-classes, are capable of maintaining a panmictic population despite the genetic distinctiveness of individual year-classes. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

However, few studies examine this temporal and spatial variation over large portions of a species' geographic range or between cryptic species that overlap in their range. Despite the potential for long-distance dispersal in blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus, a previous study of adults revealed two geographically distinct, cryptic species. To determine year-to-year variation in the patterns of spatial connectivity and to elucidate the potential ecological mechanisms involved in shaping new yearclasses and maintaining cryptic species, we sampled juveniles within California, USA, where both cryptic species coexist. Using microsatellite markers, we found geographic and temporal variation in the number of individuals from these distinct cryptic species within 2 new year-classes of juvenile S. mystinus. We also found differences in the geographic patterns of genetic structure of the 2 cryptic species. Whereas one species exhibited little or no spatial genetic structure across the study region, the other exhibited a complex geographic pattern of genetic structure, with little or no genetic structure among regions, but small-scale structure within a region. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial scales and patterns of realized dispersal of pelagic larvae vary geographically, interannually, and between closely related species with similar life-history strategies. Therefore, estimates of dispersal based on larval duration and patterns of adult structure need to be interpreted cautiously. © Inter-Research 2011.},

The brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) occurs in nearshore habitat and is common from northern Baja California, Mexico to northern California, rare off the outer coast of Oregon and Washington and again common in the inland waters of Puget Sound, Washington. Here we examine patterns of microsatellite DNA diversity from throughout the species' range as an indirect measure of long-term trends in larval dispersal. Genetic divergence was large and highly significant over all populations (FST = 0.056, P {\textless} 0.0001), and was significantly correlated with geographic distance when considering coastal populations. The best estimates of mean coastal dispersal distance were on the order of 10 km or less per generation. Diversity was relatively low in the Puget Sound, suggesting that Puget Sound rockfish populations experienced a post-glacial founder effect followed by genetic isolation and low effective population size. Puget Sound individuals appeared to have recent mixed ancestry as a result of introgression with S. maliger and S. caurinus. Genetic isolation of Puget Sound fish provides a basis for consideration as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. We recommend that coastal brown rockfish fisheries be managed at regional rather than coast-wide scales, and that design of marine reserve networks considers the surprisingly low realized dispersal distance of some species with high dispersal potential. © Springer 2005.},

In addition, modeling potential evolutionary scenarios and testing for evolutionary processes shaping the current population structure were undertaken to better understand factors contributing to population structure and speciation in the subgenus. Results of this study were compared to previous research on members of this and other subgenera within the genus Sebastes to identify concordance in the phylogeography of subgenera or consistent processes between species indicative of common mechanisms contributing to genetic variation. Patterns observed were used to infer prioritization of future testing for population structure in the genus Sebastes and research to determine whether they are predictive. No significant population structure was identified in the canary rockfish S. pinniger (Gill 1864) or the sunset rockfish S. crocotulus (Hyde et al. 2008). Three genetically distinct genetic clusters indicative of separate populations were identified in the vermilion rockfish S. miniatus (Jordan and Gilbert 1880) and population structure correlated with latitude and depth. While populations were found to overlap in their distribution to some extent, population structure was consistent with the boundary between the San Diegan and Oregonian biogeographic provinces near Point Conception, California. Additional population structure in the Southern California Bight south of Point Conception was correlated with adult depth distribution with a break around 60 m (30 fathoms (fm)). Assignment tests indicated that the young of year of each population as well as S. miniatus co-occur and reside in kelp forests before making ontogenetic migration to deeper depths with age. The deepest distributed of these clusters commonly occurs in depths of up to 100 m (50 fm), beyond which S. crocotulus was the most common species 2 (Hyde et al. 2007). This population structure related to depth poses issues for stratification of historical data used in stock assessment and allocation of catch to each population as identifying characteristics have not been identified and management is already confounded by the presence of the recently identified cryptic species S. crocotulus. Previous studies hypothesized that speciation between S. crocotulus and S. miniatus was the result of paedomorphsis in the form of concatenated migration to deeper depth isolating populations by depth arising from the greater area of nearshore habitat around the channel islands during early Pliocene glaciations when sea level falls as much as 300 ft. around 2.3 MYA (Hyde et al. 2008). Tests were conducted for repetition of such a pattern in forming population structure observed in S. miniatus. Timing of divergence in S. miniatus populations identified using assignment tests was estimated to be in the late Pleistocene only 102,429 (95\% CI: 22,884 – 248,933) thousand years ago between clusters 1 and 2 and 255,141 (95\% CI: 80,080 - 592,847) thousand years ago for their common ancestor and cluster 3. This is consistent with timing of glaciations, but results indicate northward expansion of a population, which may have occurred during an interglacial period. Our analyses indicate that mutation contributes significantly to population structure between species in the subgenus, but does not contribute to population structure in S. miniatus indicating that it is due to more recent drift or selection alone. Population structure in S. miniatus consistent with northward migration of S. miniatus with lower genetic diversity indicative of a founder effect and private alleles accumulated in the time since divergence. No signal of bottleneck was present in any of the species or populations, though a model reflecting a reduction in population size in the northern population was found to have a high likelihood and posterior probability in Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis of potential evolutionary scenarios. It is possible that reductions in population size occurred too many generations ago to be detected using methods based on relationships between number of alleles and heterozygosity, given expansion of the population since its initial isolation. The results of modeling evolutionary processes indicated potential for gene flow between the northern population and deeper southern population potentially resulting in the shallow southern population. This may be the result of shared alleles from incomplete lineage sorting rather than admixture, or admixture occurred in the distant past as little evidence hybridization was observed in tests for individuals of hybrid classes. The southern shallow population had higher genetic diversity indicating that it may be an older stable population, in potential glacial refugia to the south. These results are also consistent with the possibility that population structure in S. miniatus as the result of northward expansion during the interglacial period. Though the presence of a distinct deeper population in the southern California bight is consistent with paedomorphosis posed as the mechanism resulting in divergence between S. miniatus and S. crocotulus in Hyde et al. (2008), the processes leading to the division of adults on the basis of depth is still uncertain between the shallower and deeper southern population. We postulated that migration or shifts in abundance over time to 3 glacial refugia in the south during glaciations may be associated with shifts to deeper depths to align with lower temperatures experienced at higher latitudes during the interglacial. Adults of each population would be potentially isolated from the shallower distributed progenitor taking advantage of ample nearshore habitat in the Southern California Bight during glaciations (Jacobs et al. 2007, Hyde et al. 2008). Having shifted abundance to the south and taken on adaptations to deeper depths, the now more deeply distributed population may remain isolated from the southerly shallow populations. While concordance was imperfect, analogous structure in other Subgenera within the Sebastes including the Sebastosomas (Burford and Bernardi 2008), Pteropodus (Li et al. 2006) and Sebastomus (Rocha-Oliveras et al. 1999) that reflect population structure north and south of Point Conception as well as cryptic population structure with depth in cowcod (Hess et al. 2014), which we observed in the Rosicola. In other subgenera, differentiation is commonly accompanied by color variation and many of the sister species with similar indices of differentiation to populations identified in S. miniatus are identified as separate species due to their disparate coloration. This may in part be the result of sexual selection facilitated by internal fertilization (Gunderson and Vetter 2006). Commonalities provide guidance on prioritizing future research to focus on species with distributions bridging Point Conception and a broad range of depth distributions. In addition, species with variable coloration should be considered for analysis as the line between species may be blurry but somewhat visible to the eye, needing only be confirmed by genetic analysis that can detect differentiation that in this case was indicative of a relatively recently diverged sister species (Frable et al. 2015, Narum et al. 2004). Nearshore species that release their larvae in the “sticky water” closer to shore that is slower moving due to turbulence and shear forces slowing its movement in the prevailing currents (Gunderson and Vetter 2006; Berntson and Moran 2009). This may contribute to maintenance of populations structure due to relatively inhibited larval transport compared to congeners in deeper waters spawning during periods of stronger flow of currents along the coast. These results provide guidance on selection of species for further analysis within the subgenus to identify what might be population structure or cryptic species that should be accounted for in stock assessments and management where possible. Nearshore species with large ranges bridging Point Conception, California, spawning in the spring during maximal upwelling, with broad depth range and with a large degree of variability in coloration are most likely to harbor genetic variation of interest to management and their analysis may provide further understanding the speciation process in this diverse genus.},

Experimental results with freshwater and diadromous fish have been consistent with this paradigm, but with marine fish, they have often been ambiguous or contradictory. A review of water chemistry data indicated that Sr:Ca (mmol:mol) levels were higher in marine water than in most freshwater systems and that Sr:Ca variability was lower in marine water than in most freshwater systems. We therefore hypothesized that lifetime otolith Sr:Ca profiles of freshwater fish would exhibit low levels of Sr:Ca with moderate variability, of diadromous fish would exhibit highly variable Sr:Ca levels, and of marine fish would exhibit high levels of Sr:Ca with low variability. Otolith Sr:Ca profiles from 81 species of freshwater, diadromous, and marine fish revealed that freshwater fish had low levels of Sr:Ca and lower variability than expected relative to marine fish, diadromous fish had Sr:Ca levels and variability that were consistent with expectations, and marine fish had high maximum Sr:Ca levels, as expected, and high Sr:Ca variability, similar in magnitude to diadromous fish, which was not expected.

In situ video was used to quantify flatfish behavioral responses to a bottom trawl sweep to improve the understanding of survey and assessment results. The behavior of 632 flatfishes was recorded during four tows. More than 90\% of fish were observed in a perpendicular orientation away from the sweeps indicating a herding response. There was no significant effect of fish length on fish orientation or whether it reacted or remained stationary during the observation. Only 1.3\% of fish were observed escaping the sweeps. A generalized linear model was used to estimate that at a distance of 73.8. cm (±3.4 SE) 50\% of observed fish reacted to the sweep. The mean distance that stationary fish were first observed reacting to the sweep was 36.6. cm (±2.0 SE). Quantitative analysis indicates that flatfish herding occurs along trawl sweeps and the effective area swept is greater than the wing spread. Thus, the use of wing spread to calculate relative abundance estimates explains bias in stock assessment estimates of survey catchability that are greater than expected. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Trawl skippers usually choose between known fishing opportunities, which are observed as groups of trawls that are conducted in the same portion of a fishing ground, or go exploratory fishing. We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (fishing opportunities) using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. Fishing opportunities were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard deviation 16, range 2-69) of fishing opportunities. Within each fishing opportunity, trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method could also be used to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. Fishing opportunities could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries. © 2005 NRC Canada.},

In all cases, fishing fleets behave rationally within the imposed regulatory structures. Successful, generalist fishermen who take risks often pioneer developing fisheries. At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment.

The description and staging scheme developed provide a basis to compare reproductive developmental patterns between cycles and populations. Oogonia (Stage I) and early perinucleolus (Stage II) oocytes were present in samples from all months. Progressive growth of oocytes from early- to late perinucleolus (Stage III) was evident in spent and recovering ovaries, indicating the end of a reproductive year and the beginning of a new reproductive cycle. Initial yolk accumulation (Stage IV) occurred in July, and final yolk accumulation (Stage V) was predominant from September through January. In February, the majority of samples displayed fertilized ova in early-celled stages of embryonic development.

In the summer upwelling season, juveniles may be captured in tidepools and shallow coastal waters, where temperatures may be as low as 8°C, or in shallow estuarine habitats where temperatures reach 18°C. This study was conducted to determine the effects of temperature, ration, and fish size upon growth. Juveniles 35 to 93 mm standard length were acclimated to 7°, 12°, and 18°C and provided four daily rations (nominally 0, 25, 50, and 100\% maximum ration); growth and food consumption were monitored over 57 days. Growth in length ranged from -0.023 to 0.314 mm per day, relative growth in weight ranged from -0.689 to 1.495\% body weight per day, and gross conversion efficiencies ranged from -13 to 21\% among treatments. Under starvation conditions, weight loss increased with increasing temperature. At rations expressed as percent maximum at a given temperature, growth increased with increasing temperature. Maximum relative ration (\% body weight per day), however, decreased with decreasing temperature; at equivalent relative rations, growth did not differ significantly among temperatures. Evacuation rates determined at the experimental temperatures suggest that daily ration is limited by digestion rate and that temperature therefore affects energy turnover. Growth was analyzed with multiple regression models with ration, temperature, and initial weight as independent variables. Relative growth increased with increasing initial weight. The model predicts that relative maintenance rations decrease with increasing size. The percentage of full ration represented by maintenance ration is relatively greater for small fish at low temperatures, suggesting a basis for ontogenetic change in thermal optima for growth. The results of this study suggest that thermal environment may have an important effect upon first year growth of juvenile S. melanops. © 1983 Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

To statistically verify pattern matching, we fit each time series of otolith measurements with a spline, and all measurements were divided by the values predicted by the curve. This standardized each time series to a mean of 1, removing the effects of age on growth and homogenizing variance. Each time series was then correlated with the average growth patterns of all other series, yielding an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.53. Average growth of all 50 samples was significantly correlated with an upwelling index (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (r = -0.29, p = 0.007), and the Northern Oscillation Index (r - 0.51, p = 0.0001), corroborating accuracy.

We describe efforts to support reducing rockfish bycatch in central California trawl fisheries by testing the efficacy of move-on rules on catch data from 2002 to 2010. Move-on rules are regulations or guidelines that trigger the temporary closure of a fishery in a targeted area when a bycatch threshold is reached, without the closure of the entire fishery. Move-on rules based on spatiotemporal autocorrelation (clustering) were effective in reducing bycatch with modest impact on target catch, removing between 35\% and 77\% of future hauls with bycatch within a specified distance and time of a bycatch-containing haul, while foregoing target catch by an average of 12\%. The spatial and temporal peak clustering scales show correlation with the level of schooling behavior by each species; however, the efficiency of the rules measured either in reduction in bycatch hauls or diminished target catch was not strongly affected by those aggregation behaviors. Our analysis provides information for fishers, such as those in the California Risk Pool, in the continuing development of responses that are more refined in both scale and impact.},

	abstract = {Growth of two Sebastes species was measured as fish length versus age, determined from otoliths. S. pinnigerand S. diploproa were collected extensively over their wide latitudinal ranges in the northeast Pacific Ocean. In both species, females grew faster and larger than males. Growth of S. pinnigerdid not vary with latitude. For S. diploproa, however, there was a cline of increasing growth with higher latitude. In the habitat of the adult fish, which are demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope, latitudinal variation in environmental factors, such as temperature and oxygen concentration, appears insufficient to account for the observed differences in growth. Thus two other possible causes of the growth cline are discussed. First, S. diploproa has been exploited by fisheries more in the north than in the south, possibly resulting in more available prey and thus increased growth in the north (short term density-dependent response). The second possible cause is a density-independent, evolutionary response at the population level characterized by differences in reproductive strategy. Reproductive success in the southern part of the range of this species is probably less predictable due to the effects of oceanographic currents on the survival of epipelagic larvae and prejuveniles; reproductive effort in the south would therefore be greater. The relative importance of the suggested mechanisms for growth differences requires further elucidation from population genetics and studies of density effects and fishing pressure.},

All time series were exactly dated and spanned 1972 through 1994. In a principal components analysis, the leading principal component (PC1bio) accounted for 64\% of the variance in the data set. By entering the upwelling index, the Northern Oscillation index, sea surface temperatures, and the multivariate ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) index into principal components analysis, a time series of environmental variability PC1env was developed for each month of the year. Over the interval 1972 through 1994, PC1bio most strongly correlated with PC1env for February and, to a lesser extent, January and March. Moreover, when each of the six biological time series was related to the 12 PC1env through stepwise multiple regression, February was always the most significant (p {\textless} 0.01). The same was true if upwelling index was substituted for PC1env. As upper-trophic predators, rockfish and seabirds independently corroborate that wintertime ocean conditions are critical for productivity in the California Current ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Over 60 species of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) reside off the coast of California, many of which are economically important to both recreational and commercial fisheries. Rockfish are live-bearers with a diverse array of reproductive strategies. Understanding the reproductive potential of an exploited stock is critical to assessing the health and status of a fishery. We investigated the reproductive ecology of four rockfish species to examine species contrasts and to determine spatial and maternal-size effects on reproductive potential. Females were sampled during the winter parturition season (November through March) of 2009 through 2012. Maternal length and somatic weight were positively correlated with relative fecundity (larvae per g somatic weight) in all four species, indicating a disproportionately greater reproductive output by larger, older females. Fecundity estimates in Chilipepper, S. goodei, and Yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, varied regionally, but did not significantly differ over time within the years sampled (sample sizes for Speckled, S. ovalis, and Blackgill rockfish, S. melanostomus, were too small to allow spatiotemporal comparisons). Two reproductive strategies were evident as Yellowtail and Blackgill rockfish produced a relatively highly fecund, single brood of smaller-sized larvae annually, in contrast to Chilipepper and Speckled rockfish, which produced larger-sized larvae with lower fecundity. In some regions multiple broods were common, complicating estimates of annual fecundity for these two species. There was some evidence that egg production was positively correlated with female condition, indicating that environmental variability in oceanographic conditions and productivity may drive changes in fecundity and reproductive strategy (i.e., single versus multiple broods).},
