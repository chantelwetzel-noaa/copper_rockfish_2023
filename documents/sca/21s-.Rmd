## Fishery-Independent Data

Three fishery-independent data sources with indices of abundance were included in the base model. These surveys sampled rocky habitat across the area `r area` and sampled both areas opens to fishing (termed reference areas) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs, Figure \ref{fig:survey-locations}). Figure \ref{fig:survey-locations} indicate CDFW area blocks by grey grid lines with areas that `r spp` would be expected to be found based (Merit McCrea, personal communication).
