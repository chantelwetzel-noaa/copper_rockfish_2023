### Growth Data {#growth-data}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age not associated with fishery fleets or surveys incorporated in the model were available for `r spp`. These independent age data collection efforts from three programs `r area` since 2003: 621 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 33 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, and 506 otoliths collected by a cooperative research survey by the SWFSC and CPFV funded by the Sportfishing Association of California (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these three sources were included in the model as a "growth" fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. These collection had a wide distribution of length and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).
