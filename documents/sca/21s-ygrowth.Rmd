### Growth Data {#growth-data}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age data not associated with fishery fleets or surveys incorporated in the model were available for `r spp`. These age data were collected by three programs `r area` since 2004: 621 otoliths from the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 33 otoliths from a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, and 506 otoliths from a cooperative research survey by the SWFSC and CPFV funded by the Sportfishing Association of California (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). Numerous explorations were conducted to evaluate how best to incorporate these data within the base model. These data were split into two growth fleets based on the collection method. The samples from the `r wcgbt` were split into their own growth fleet and the lengths associated with the ages were added to the model to estimate a length-based selectivity for these samples collected via trawl gear (Figures \ref{fig:growth-wcgbt-len} and \ref{fig:growth-mean-wcgbt-len}).  The ages collected by Pearson and the CPFV cooperative research samples were combined into a second growth fleet. The lengths associated with these fish were included in the model to estimate a length-based selectivity (Figures \ref{fig:growth-coop-len} and \ref{fig:growth-mean-coop-len}). These collections had a wide distribution of length and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).
