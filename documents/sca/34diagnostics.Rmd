## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered using the jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using jitter input of 0.10. This was repeated 100 times with 17 out of 100 runs returning to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. In the jittering analysis models with similar log-likelihood values (difference < 0.50 units) were often found with little difference in overall model estimates indicating a somewhat flat likelihood surface around the maximum likelihood estimate. Additionally, jitters using a smaller jitter value yielded an increased frequency of runs returning to the base model with no models finding a better fit to the data. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses {#sensitivities}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of specific changes to data inputs and model structural assumptions to further address uncertainty associated with the base model estimates and derived management quantities. The majority of the sensitivity models are the result of a single change relative to base model (i.e., they are not the result of cumulative changes such as the modeling approach used with the bridging analysis). Comparisons of likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from the sensitivity analysis are shown in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}-\ref{tab:sensitivities-3}. Comparison of all sensitivities relative to the base model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sens-all} with Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:sens-depl-3} showing the change in spawning output and the relative spawning output trajectories. Many additional sensitivity runs were explored during development and testing of the base model. This section focuses on the main data and structural sensitivity model runs and includes the following:

Structural Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item  Estimate natural mortality ($M$) for each sex.
  
  \item Estimate steepness ($h$).
  
  \item Estimate $M$ for each sex and $h$.
  
  \item Fix recruitment to be equal to the stock-recruitment curve (no recruitment deviations).
  
  \item Set the CPFV selectivity to be asymptotic for the period of 2004-2022.
  
  \item Apply Dirichlet data weights.
  
  \item Apply McAllister-Ianelli data weights.

\end{enumerate}

Data Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Reduce the PR catch between 1970-1982 to half of the fleet's average catch for that period of time.
  
  \item Eliminate down weighting of the historical CPFV ages (lambda = 1.0).
  
  \item Remove all age data and fix growth at the estimates.
  
  \item Remove the CPFV cooperative collection ages in 2022.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC WCGBT survey lengths and ages.
  
  \item Remove all fishery-dependent indices of abundance.
  
  \item Remove the CCFRP Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the CDFW ROV survey data (index and lengths).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey age data only.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey length and age data (retain only the index of abundance).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey index of abundance (retain the lengths and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line, CCFRP Hook and Line, and CDFW ROV survey data (indices, lengths, and ages).

\end{enumerate}

Across all the sensitivities conducted only a subset resulted in distinct changes in the model estimates and the discussion here will focus on the sensitivities that were identified in Figure \ref{fig:sens-all}. The sensitivity that did not estimate annual recruitment deviations and predicted recruitment directly from the stock-recruitment curve resulted in the model estimating a higher initial unfished recruitment ($R_0$), a higher spawning output in the final model year, and a less depleted stock (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). The dynamics of `r spp` `r area` appear to be highly driven by strong or weak recruitment variations combined with exploitation. In order to fit the data in the absence of recruitment variation the model needs to adjust the derived quantities accordingly.  

Both sensitivities that explored the impact of alternative data weighting methodologies resulted in differences relative to the base model in derived final spawning output and relative spawning output (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). The suggested data weights from the Dirichlet methodology for most data types hit the upper bound on data-weighting of 1.0 (Table \ref{tab:dw}). These suggested data weights for the length data may be due to the input sample sizes not being equal to the number of fish sampled and if the data processing were revised, the suggested data weights may be less than those estimated here. However, the Dirichlet data weighting approach also estimated data weights at the upper bound of 1.0 for the majority of age data sources which in most instances had an input sample size equal to the number of fish. Similar behavior in data weights suggested by the Dirichlet method have been encountered across other sensitivities for previous assessments (e.g. petrale sole in 2019, copper rockfish in 2021). In order to understand what is behind this behavior, additional simulation work should be conducted to inform how this approach should be applied.  The other data weighting approach, McAllister-Ianelli, also estimated a higher final spawning output and relative status compared to the base model (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). Much of the exploratory modeling work conducted for this assessment used either Francis or McAllister-Ianelli. Models that used the McAllister-Ianelli data-weighting for `r spp` `r area` seemed to generally have issues converging to the true maximum likelihood estimate (MLE, e.g., jitter commonly identified a model with a lower MLE) with this issue also extending to challenges when conducting likelihood profiles. These issues pertained to this sensitivity run where running diagnostics for this sensitivity revealed an inability of the MLE being repeatedly identified (i.e., out of 100 jitters run at a level of 0.10, only one run returned to the true MLE) and likelihood parameter profiles that failed to converge to a reasonable model.

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by successively removing years of data ranging from 2017 - 2021 (i.e., “Data -1 Years” corresponds to data through 2021). The estimated spawning output for all retrospectives was higher at the start of the time series and lower for the final model years (Figure ref{fig:retro-ssb}). There are a signficant number of ages only available in 2022 leading to this slight decline in estimated spawning output when the most recent data were removed. Additionally, removing five-years of data completely removes all data from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey and a majority of the data point from the CDFW ROV survey.  The estimates of relative spawning output to unfished decreased with each subsequent data peel compared to the base model but were within the uncertainty intervals  (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and sex-specific natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.
