## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered using the jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using jitter input of 0.10. This was repeated 100 times with 17 out of 100 runs returning to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. In the jittering analysis models with similar log-likelihood values (difference < 0.50 units) were often found with little difference in overall model estimates indicating a somewhat flat likelihood surface around the maximum likelihood estimate. Additionally, jitters using a smaller jitter value yielded an increased frequency of runs returning to the base model with no models finding a better fit to the data. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses {#sensitivities}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of specific changes to data inputs and model structural assumptions to further address uncertainty associated with the base model estimates and derived management quantities.  The majority of the sensitivity models are the result of a single change relative to base model (i.e., they are not the result of cumulative changes such as the modeling approach used with the bridging analysis). Comparisons of likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from the sensitivity analysis are shown in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}-\ref{tab:sensitivities-3}. Comparison of all sensitivities relative to the base model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sens-all} with Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:sens-depl-3} showing the change in spawning output and the relative spawning output trajectories. Many additional sensitivity runs were explored during development and testing of the base model. This section focuses on the main data and structural sensitivity model runs and includes the following:

Structural Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item  Estimate natural mortality ($M$) for each sex.
  
  \item Estimate steepness ($h$).
  
  \item Estimate $M$ for each sex and $h$.
  
  \item Fix recruitment to be equal to the stock-recruitment curve (no recruitment deviations).
  
  \item Set the CPFV selectivity to be asymptotic for the period of 2004-2022.
  
  \item Apply Dirichlet data weights.
  
  \item Apply McAllister-Ianelli data weights.

\end{enumerate}

Data Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Reduce the PR catch between 1970-1982 to half of the fleet's average catch for that period of time.
  
  \item Eliminate down weighting of the historical CPFV ages (lambda = 1.0).
  
  \item Remove all age data and fix growth at the estimates.
  
  \item Remove the CPFV cooperative collection ages in 2022.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC WCGBT survey lengths and ages.
  
  \item Remove all fishery-dependent indices of abundance.
  
  \item Remove the CCFRP Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the CDFW ROV survey data (index and lengths).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey age data only.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey length and age data (retain only the index of abundance).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey index of abundance (retain the lengths and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line, CCFRP Hook and Line, and CDFW ROV survey data (indices, lengths, and ages).

  
\end{enumerate}


### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by successively removing years of data ranging from 2013 - 2022 (i.e., "Data -1 Years" corresponds to data through 2021).

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and sex-specific natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.
