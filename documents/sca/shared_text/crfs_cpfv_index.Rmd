The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling program in 1999 (Monk et al. 2014 XXX). California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. (1998 XXX). During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records locationspecific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.

The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for `r spp``. Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at the level of a fisherâ€™s bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.
