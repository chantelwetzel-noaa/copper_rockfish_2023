From 1980 to 2003 the MRFSS program conducted dockside intercept surveys of the recreational CPFV fishing fleet. No MRFSS CPUE data are available for the years 1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. Sampling of California CPFVs north of Point Conception was further delayed, and CPFV samples in 1993 and 1994 are limited to San Luis Obispo County. For purposes of this assessment, the MRFSS time series was truncated at 1999 due to sampling overlap with the onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept
survey for the same vessel).

Each entry in the RecFIN Type 3 database corresponds to a single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers being interviewed. The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials (“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).
