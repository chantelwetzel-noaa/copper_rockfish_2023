# Introduction

This assessment report describes the sub-area population of `r spp` (*Sebastes caurinus*) off the California coast `r area` in U.S. waters, using data through 2022. The sub-area population north of Point Conception in California waters was also evaluated and is described in a separate assessment report. The `r spp` status for the California stock of `r spp` is determined by the combined estimates of spawning output from both sub-areas and is detailed in Management, Section \ref{management}. This assessment does not account for populations located in Mexico waters or other areas off the U.S. coast and assumes that these southern and northern populations do not contribute to the population being assessed here.

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

Off the coast of California south of Point Conception `r spp` is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality of `r spp` across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The recreational fishery is comprised of individual recreational fishers (Private/Rental, PR) and commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFV) also known as party/charter (PC) which take groups of individuals out for day fishing trips. Across both types of recreational fishing the majority of effort occurs around rocky reefs that can be accessed via day-trips. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text", '1_intro_ca_commercial.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

`r Spp` residing between Point Conception and the Mexico/U.S. border are assessed here as a separate sub-area (Figure \ref{fig:ca-map}). This designation was made based on oceanographic, geographic, and fishery conditions. The `r spp` population in California waters was split at Point Conception due to water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish populations to the north and south. Additionally, the fairly sedentary nature of adult `r spp` likely limits flow of fish between south and north of Point Conception. 

## Summary of Management History and Performance

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text", '1_intro_management.Rmd')

```
These new recreational depth restrictions will be particularly impactful to the CPFV fleet south of Point Conception where it represents the majority of recreational catch.

# Data

Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models. The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors.
These factors often include, but are not limited to,
the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency);
the spatial and temporal coverage of the data;
the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit;
the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance;
timing of when the data were provided;
limitations imposed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Terms of Reference; and
the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model.
Attributes associated with a data source can change through time,
as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes).
Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for `r spp`.
Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model.
Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:data-plot)) and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below.
Data that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or had not changed since their past exploration in a previous `r spp` stock assessment when they were not used.
In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources were explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \@ref(assessment-model)).

## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery {#commercial-fishery}

#### Landings and Discards

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'2f_commercial_removals.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```


#### Composition Data
\

Biological data were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System on March 20, 2023. Length data for the commercial fleet were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples for north↨ of Point Conception beginning in 1983 (Tables \ref{tab:dead-com-len} and \ref{tab:live-com-len}). The commercial data was split by landed condition, live or dead, with the first data for the live fish fishery beginning in 1999. The number of length samples by fleet were highly variable with the largest number of samples by year being recorded in the mid- to late-1990s for the dead fish fishery. In recent years, the number of length samples by year are limited for both fleets. The number of samples prior to 1995 and in the 2000s for the dead fish fishery were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations any year with less than 20 sampled fish were considered too sparse to accurately reflect the fleet selectivity for that year (see [Appendix A](#excluded-data) for implied fits to these lengths). 

The majority of lengths sampled from the commercial fleet landing dead `r spp` ranged between approximately 25 - 45 cm starting in the early 1990s with some additional observations of larger fish in earlier years (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-len-data}, detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}).  The mean length observed by year ranged between approximately 35 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-dead-len-data}). The mean observed length in the earliest data is variable ranging between 40 -45 cm, declining in the 1990s to less than 40 cm, then increasing to slightly larger mean size across the sparse data of the early 2000s, and then increasing again in the most recent years. There were only a few age samples (8 total) from the commercial dead fleet that were collected in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-age-data}). By chance, all of these ages were from from female fish. These data were incorporated into the model as marginal age data associated with this fleet. 

The observed distribution of sizes sampled from the commercial live fish fleet were generally variable based on the more limited sample sizes but ranging between 30 - 40 cm with missing years of data across different time periods (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-len-data}). The observed mean length of fish landed live was highly variable with means often below 35 cm with the smallest observed mean size being observed in the final year of data (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-live-len-data}).  

The input sample sizes for all commercial data initially were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

During initial model evaluations alternative data weighting approaches suggested potentially high up-weighting the samples from the commercial live fish fishery. In order to ensure that the data were not up-weighted beyond the total annual sample size the input sample size was revised to be equal to the number of lengths samples.

### Recreational Fishery {#recreational-fishery}

#### Landings and Discards
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'2f_recreational_removals.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

Recreational catch data is reported by district in CRFS where district 1 (aka South) and district 2 (aka Channel) are located `r area`. The proportion of removals by the CPFV fleet since 2004 by district are shown in Table \ref{tab:crfs-by-district} (see the Appendix, Section \ref{cpfv-samples}, for additional information about sampling and data by CDFW districts)

#### Indices of Abundance
\

A number of indices of abundance were explored for the recreational fleet (Figure \ref{fig:stand-cpue}). Discarded catch is available from onboard observer surveys, but was not included in indices. Indices developed for the assessment include:

* CDFW CPFV/PC onboard observer index (1999-2019)
* CRFS PR1 sites dockside survey (2004-2019)

Due to limited sampling during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inseason action taken by CDFW for 2022 reducing sub-bag limits for `r spp` across California, both recreational fishery indices of abundance excluded data collected after 2019.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'21f_crfs_cpfv_index.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

The CRFS CPFV index of abundance was low in the early years of the time-series between 1999-2004 and then began to increase with variability among years until 2013, and declined in the final years (Figure \ref{fig:crfs-index-main}). See the Appendix Section {onboard-cpfv-index} for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection.

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2019, and 2021-2022, were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e., effort units are angler trips), angler-reported distance from shore (Area X: inside/outside of 3 nm), county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. Only data through 2019 were used to develop an index of abundance due to potential changes in angler behavior in 2021 and management changes in 2022. See Appendix Section \ref{crfs-pr-index} for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection. The CRFS PR index of abundance generally increased between 2004-2016, with the final years of the index stabilizing or slightly declining (Figure \ref{fig:crfs-pr-index-main}).


#### Composition Data
\

Length compositions were available from the following sources: 

* Recreational party/charter mode (CPFV/PC)

  + Collins and Crooke onboard observer survey (1975-1978)
  + MRFSS CPFV/PC dockside survey (1980-1989, 1993-2003)
  + Ally onboard observer survey (1984-1989)
  + CRFS CPFV/PC onboard dockside survey (2004-2022)

* Recreational private/rental mode (PR)

  + MRFSS dockside PR survey (1980-1989, 1993-2003)
  + CRFS dockside PR survey (2004-2022)

  
The number of available fish and unique trips by year and fleet are in Table \ref{tab:rec-len-samps}.  MRFSS historical biological data were downloaded from the RecFIN website in December 2022. CRFS biological data were also downloaded from RecFIN on February 18, 2023. The Collins and Crooke and Ally recreational survey data were downloaded from the SWFSC databases on February 12, 2023. In the CRFS era which reports samples by CDFW district the majority of length samples `r area` arise from CDFW district 2 (Channel Islands, Table \ref{tab:rec-samps-by-district}).

Nearly all of the length samples for both recreational fleets, CPFV and PR, were unsexed (only two sexed fish in the CPFV data were added to the unsexed data). A wide range of lengths from the recreational CPFV fleet were observed across all years with lengths generally ranging between 20 - 40 cm except for the late 1970s and early 1980s where a higher proportion of larger fish were sampled (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-len-data}). The mean of lengths observed in the recreational CPFV fleet by is variable with mean length increasing until the early 1980s, decreasing until the mid-1990s, increasing until 2000, stabilizing with some variability through the early 2010s, and then slowly increasing in the most recent years of data (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-cpfv-len-data}). The length distribution by CDFW district from the CPFV fleet since 2004 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-dist}. The range of lengths sampled from the recreational PR fleet are similar to those from the CPFV fleet with lengths in recent years ranging between 20 - 40 cm (Figures \ref{fig:rec-pr-len-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rec-pr-len-data}). 

Age data collected by the recreational CPFV fleet were collected in two separate years, 1975 and 2022. The historical age data were from a total of 84 unsexed fish and were incorporated in the model as marginal age data (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-age-data}). In 2022, a total of 508 age samples from the final model year, 2022, were collected in a cooperative program with assistance from the fleet coordination by the SWFSC. These data were collected by four CPFV vessels that operate south of Point Conception following random sampling protocols. The lengths collected associated with fish collected by the cooperative for aging were compared to all the CPFV lengths collected by the CRFS sampling program (Figure \ref{fig:coop-len-comparison}). This comparison revealed that there were distinct differences in the length of fish in these two data sets where the cooperative collected data tended to have more large fish. The CRFS length data sample size was less than half of the sample size of cooperative age data collection (CRFS sampled 243 from 78 trips, Table  \ref{tab:rec-len-samps}). The source of these differences is not entirely clear, but could be arising from a difference in sampling areas within the region `r area` where there appear to be size and abundance differences in the more southern areas compared to areas around the Channel Islands. Given the differences in the age samples to the lengths sampled by the CRFS program, these ages were not linked to the CPFV fleet in the model.  However, these data are an important source of age-length information for `r spp`, so these data were added to a growth fleet in the model (see the [Growth Data](#growth-data) section)

The approach to determine the number of unique trips by data source varied. Only Collins and Crook data had unique trip numbers within the data. Other data sources that lacked clear trip identifier applied a similar methodology as developed by Brian Soper that combines multiple fields of information to attempt to estimate trips sampled. The number of trips for MRFSS data was estimated using the year, wave, ID code, sampling site (INSITE), area, and mode. A similar methodology was done for CRFS that used data, county, water area, interview site, and mode. Finally, trips for the Ally survey data were based on year, complex, landing, and district.

## Fishery-Independent Data

Three fishery-independent data sources with indices of abundance were included in the base model. These surveys sampled rocky habitat across the area `r area` (Figure \ref{fig:survey-locations}) and sampled both areas opens to fishing (termed reference areas) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs, Figure \ref{fig:ref-mpa}).

### California Collaborative Fisheries Reserach Program

#### Index of Abundance
\

Since 2007, the \gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \glspl{mpa} and understand nearshore fish populations
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California
(A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast.
Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \glspl{cpfv} guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500-m grid cells within and outside \glspl{mpa}. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth; since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.

The estimated index of abundance was weighted based on sample locations outside (reference) and inside MPAs (73 and 80 percent of areas open to fishing in the north and south, respectively, see Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index} for additional information). The highest index point is associated with the first index year, 2017, varies between 2018-2021, and has the lowest value in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-index-main}, see Appendix Section \ref{ccfrp-index} for additional information on the development of the index).

#### Composition Data
\

Length measurements were available each year the CCFRP has operated `r area` and age data were collected in 2022 by the survey (Table \ref{tab:ccfrp-samps}). The length data by designation, MPA and Reference, were weighted based on the estimated rocky habitat within each designation north and south of Point Conception (73 and 80 percent of areas open to fishing in the north and south, respectively, see Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index} for additional information). The lengths observed by the survey ranged between 20-45 cm across the sample years with the mean lengths observed ranging between 33-36 cm (Figures \ref{fig:ccfrp-len-data} and \ref{fig:ccfrp-mean-len-data}). The survey collected age data from a subset of fish sampled in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-age-data}). The read ages from these sampled fish ranged between 4-24 years of age.

### Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook and Line

#### Index of Abundance 
\

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-map}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the `r hkl` are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers fishing with a line with 5 hooks across a total of 5 drops per site). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008]. 

From 2004 through 2013, sampling was conducted only outside the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs). Beginning in 2014, 40 sites inside the CCAs were sampled, and roughly another 40 sites have been added in subsequent years inside the CCAs. It is important to note that some portions of the CCAs allow take for select species at depths less that 73 meters. The survey currently has 201 sites (79 inside and 122 outside the CCAs). Additionally, 16 stations within the original sample design sample areas that have been converted into either state or federal MPAs between 2007 - 2011.  

While `r spp` have not been encountered in large numbers similar to some of the other commonly encountered species (vermilion/sunset, bocaccio, greenspotted rockfish) in the `r hkl`, `r spp` has been observed every year that the survey has been conducted (Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-pos-year}). Observations of `r spp` commonly occur across a range of depths between 30 - 120 m with observations peaking around 80 m (Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-pos-depth} and Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-depth}). Across all sample years and sample sites the `r hkl`  has observed a total of 1,213 `r spp`. While `r spp` have been observed both outside and inside the CCAs in areas that restrict take or MPAs (Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-site}), the vast majority of observations of `r spp` have been outside the CCAs (1,060 observations, Tables \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-obs}). The number of `r spp` observations within the no take areas of the CCAs or MPA and open areas was explored to determine if the catch rates of `r spp` differed among the areas which determined there was not a significant difference in the observations among these areas (Table  and \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-obs-mpa}). Additionally, the data from the `r hkl` was broken out into three regions: mainland, Northern Channel Islands, and Southern Channel Islands. The highest catch rate of `r spp` was observed around the Northern Channel Islands (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-region-main}). 

The STAT explored alternative model structures to generate a standardized index of relative abundance. The final model selected was a model with a delta-lognormal model with factors of year, region, drop, covariates of number of vermilion and bocaccio observed, year/region interaction, and with random site effects. Finally, the index was weighted by the estimated proportion of rocky habitat by region. A single index of abundance was calculated using all observations from this survey (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-index-main}). Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes and model selection can be found in the Appendix Section \ref{nwfsc-hkl-model}. 

The composition and index of abundance data from the `r hkl` have been included in other nearshore assessments using various approaches. For species where the expansion of the survey into the CCAs was expected to impact the size of fish observed by this survey (e.g., vermilion/sunset rockfish and cowcod), one approach has been to estimate a single index of abundance for the whole time series but to include only composition data (length and age) starting in 2014 to estimate a single selectivity curve representative of the expansion of the survey. Since the initial analysis of the data did not indicate large changes in the catch rates or size of fish observed pre- and post-survey expansion for `r spp` all composition data were used within the base model but a sensitivity to removing all composition data before 2014 was conducted (see the [Sensitivities Section](#sensitivities) below). 

#### Composition Data 
\

`r Spp` caught in the `r hkl` were generally between 30 and 50 cm for both sexes (Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-site-len} and \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The number of lengths and ages collected by the survey are shown in Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-samples} and the length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-len-age}. The mean length observed by year was variable with an appreciable drop in the mean size observed in 2012 but has gradually increased in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}).

#### Index of Abundance
\

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'10_appendix_rov.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

The number of transects by year, location, site designation, and the numbers of `r spp` observed are shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-obs}. South of Point Conception the CDFW ROV survey generally saw the largest numbers of `r spp` around the Northern Channel Islands similar to the `r hkl` (Figure \ref{fig:rov-obs-loc}). The trend in the calculated catch-per-unit-effort based on the data alone was highly variable across sampling locations and by MPA or Reference area (Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).   

CDFW provided an initial analysis of the CDFW ROV survey data which helped in determination of which modeling approaches would be considered for these data. The STAT explored a range of alternative model structures to generate a standardized index of relative abundance for this survey. The final model selected was a delta-gamma hurdle model where the numbers of fish observed were predicted by year, site designation (MPA or Reference), proportion soft terrain, year/site designation interaction, and a random effect for the year/location interaction.  Details regarding the index of abundance, sample sizes and model selection can be found in the Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index}.

#### Composition Data 
\

Length measurements were made from images taken with stereo-cameras by the CDFW ROV survey in 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, and 2021. The ROV was equipped with two locally recorded stereo cameras mounted in a fixed orientation in parallel with the primary forward-facing camera used for navigation, identification and enumeration. Paired stereo video cameras were calibrated to provide accurate feature measurements by MARE prior to in-field data collection. Fish length was determined based on a photogrammetric intersection to calculate 3D coordinates from measured image coordinates to measure fork length to the nearest millimeter. Processors selected two 3D points, fish head and tail, on both time-synced port and starboard stereo images. Processors made note of a generated precision value that was computed alongside each measurement. The software then computed the Euclidean distance between the two 3D points to give a length measurement. Sizes were rounded to the nearest centimeter. The precision of estimates was determined and represents the repeatability and geometric quality of a measurement, and is dependent upon the location of the individual in the camera view and the clarity of the point measured. Precision values greater than 10 mm were recorded in the database alongside measurements, as precision values less than 10 mm meant measurements were deemed fully repeatable. Fish observations from initial species scoring were marked “not sizable” if the nose/tail of the fish was cut off in either stereo view, the fish was missing in one view, or the orientation of the fish obscured measurement or produced an extreme precision measurement. Fish were marked “not visible” if the fish was not visible in either the port or starboard image. Fish marked “not sizable” and “not visible” were removed from the final data set submitted by CDFW. 

The sizes observed by MPA and Reference areas north and south of Point Conception varied with a higher density of smaller fish being observed in the Reference areas (Figure \ref{fig:rov-len}). The length data by designation, MPA and Reference, were weighted based on the estimated rocky habitat within each designation north and south of Point Conception (73 and 80 percent of areas open to fishing in the north and south, respectively,  see Appendix Section \ref{cdfw-rov-index} for additional information). The CDFW ROV survey observed `r spp` between 15-50 cm in length with lower mean lengths observed in 2014 and 2015 compared to the later period between 2019-2021 (Figures \ref{fig:rov-len-data} and \ref{fig:mean-rov-len-data}).

<!--chapter:end:21s-rov.Rmd-->

### Growth Data {#growth-data}

A significant amount of additional length-at-age data not associated with fishery fleets or surveys incorporated in the model were available for `r spp`. These age data were collected by three programs `r area` since 2004: 621 otoliths from the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 33 otoliths from a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, and 506 otoliths from a cooperative research survey by the SWFSC and CPFV funded by the Sportfishing Association of California (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). Numerous explorations were conducted to evaluate how best to incorporate these data within the base model. These data were split into two growth fleets based on the collection method. The samples from the `r wcgbt` were split into their own growth fleet and the lengths associated with the ages were added to the model to estimate a length-based selectivity for these samples collected via trawl gear (Figures \ref{fig:growth-wcgbt-len} and \ref{fig:growth-mean-wcgbt-len}).  The ages collected by Pearson and the CPFV cooperative research samples were combined into a second growth fleet. The lengths associated with these fish were included in the model to estimate a length-based selectivity (Figures \ref{fig:growth-coop-len} and \ref{fig:growth-mean-coop-len}). These collections had a wide distribution of length and ages observed (Figures \ref{fig:growth-len-dist} and \ref{fig:growth-age-dist}).

```


### Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The observations of `r spp` by the `r wcgbt` are limited. The `r wcgbt` uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast and _a priori_ it would not be expected to be an informative data source for `r spp`, which are generally more closely associated with rock substrate. The `r wcgbt` had limited positive tows by year that observed `r spp` within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance for `r spp` (Table \ref{tab:wcgbt-pos-tows}). The catch-per-unit-effort across all years for the NWFSC WCGBT survey is generally small, excluding one single tow from 2012 where 1.9 mt of `r spp` were caught (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-cpue}). The observations of `r spp` by the NWFSC WCGBT survey commonly occur between 50 - 120 meters (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-depth}). The `r wcgbt` has regularly collected length and age samples from positive tows for `r spp` `r area` (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-len-age}). These data were used as conditional-age-at-length data to inform the estimation of growth within the model. See the [Length-at-Age](#length-at-age) section for data used to inform growth estimation.


### California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) survey began in 1951 and conducts quarterly cruises off southern and central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data at fixed stations and while underway; ichthyoplankon sampling with a paired bongo started in 1978. Data on larval abundance from the CalCOFI Ichthyoplankton survey have been used in stock assessments of several species, including bocaccio, cowcod and shortbelly rockfish. Although the long-term dataset is limited to a subset of species for which morphological identification of larvae has been possible, recent research has been successful at identifying a broader range of species based on genetic
identification of larvae (Thompson et al. 2016). Larval fish were enumberated from winter samples from 1998 to 2013.  Out of 36 sites, 12 observed a larval `r spp` at least once, predominantly around the northern Channel Islands.  After selecting for only those sites that observed `r spp`, we examined the proportion of positive net tows by year and the average number of `r spp` observed per tow.  Given that these values were low and the sites observing `r spp` were not well distributed, we did not use these data to develop a recruitment index for use in the assessment. 

### Southern California Bight Publicly Owned Treatment Works

In the Southern California Bight, a number of monitoring programs exist to evaluate the potential consequences of effluent discharges from waste water treatment facilities on the coastal marine environment. As over 20 million people live within an hour’s drive of the ocean in this region, a major impact to this ecosystem includes a cumulative total of 1.5 billion
liters of treated effluent released each day to the ocean, originating from 17 major waste water treatment plants. Most of these publicly owned treatment works support monitoring programs to evaluate the impacts on water and sediment quality, and associated ecological communities. For several, this includes bottom trawl surveys of coastal habitats, representing some of the longest running trawl surveys available in the region. Despite being limited spatially to waters close to population centers, these data have previously been used in stock assessments of cowcod (_Sebastes levis_) [@dick_status_2019] and California scorpionfish (_Scorpaena guttata_) [@monk_status_2017]. Investigations indicated the `r spp` are rarely observed in this survey and did not support the development of an index for this assessment.

The 50 percent size-at-maturity for `r spp` `r area ` was estimated at `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1], 1)` cm with a slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}). This area-specific maturity-at-length estimate is relatively similar to the biological maturity curve assumed for `r spp` north of Point Conception but with fish maturing at a slightly smaller size. Additionally, these values are both slightly smaller than estimates by Hannah [-@hannah_length_2014] for fish observed in Oregon waters (34.8 cm) which estimated the 50 percent size-at-maturity of and slope of -0.60.

### Growth (Length-at-Age) {#length-at-age}

Length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` informed by age data from the fisheries, the CCFRP survey, and independent efforts from four `r area` programs since 2002: 207 otoliths collected by the NWFSC WCGBT survey, 427 otoliths collected by a research survey conducted by Don Pearson, 77 from a research survey conducted by Abrams, and 508 otoliths collected by a cooperative research survey by the SWFSC and CPFV funded by the Sportfishing Association of California (Table \ref{tab:growth-age-samps}). The ages collected by these three sources were included in the model as a "growth" fleet that was not associated with removals or an index of abundance. 

Sex-specific growth parameters `r area` were initially estimated external to the model at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 45.1; $L_0$ = 1.13 cm; $k$ = 0.257 per year

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 44.8 cm; $L_0$ = 4.75 cm; $k$ = 0.262 per year

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.50cm}

These values were used as starting parameter values within the base model prior to estimating each parameter for male and female `r spp`.

### Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to 
estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the coast of California, north and south of Point Conception. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A 
series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

### Bridging Analysis

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2021 data-moderate assessment to Stock Synthesis version 3.30.21, which produced the same estimates for spawning output and the relative spawning output across the time series (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). Additional bridging analysis was conducted examining the impact of a revised model structure, updating existing data sources, and adding new data into the model. First, the fishery fleet structure was modified from the 2021 structure where the new assessment separated commercial data into two fleets based on fish landed condition, dead or live, and the recreational data into two fleets, CPFV and PR. The 2021 recreational and commercial data were reprocessed  into the new model structure through 2021 and new selectivity parameters were added to the 2021 for the newly split data. The new data available for this assessment were then added to the model retaining the same model structure where feasible in the following order:

1. Update externally estimated biology parameters for length-at-age, weight-at-age, and maturity.
2. Add new catch data for all fishery fleets.
3. Add all updated commercial and recreational length and age data.
4. Add the new fishery-dependent indices of abundance.
5. Add the CDFW ROV survey index of abundance and length data.
6. Add the CCFRP Hook and Line survey index of abundance, length, and age data.
7. Add the updated NWFSC Hook and Line survey index of abundance, length, and age data.
8. Add selectivity blocks for the commercial and recreational fishing fleets.
9. Turn on the estimation of annual recruitment deviations.
10. Add conditional-age-at-length data for the growth fleet and estimate growth parameters for both sexes.

The data bridging are shown in Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-2}. Revising the model structure, updating biology, removals, length data, adding ages, and fishery-dependent indices results in small changes to the estimated spawning output and stock status (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-1}). Adding and updating survey data, adding selectivity blocks, and estimating annual recruitment deviations and growth resulted in larger revisions in the population estimates. The largest changes in the new model relative to the 2021 assessment occurred when annual recruitment deviations were estimates resulting in a decrease in spawning output and relative spawning output at the end of the time series (Figures \ref{fig:data-bridge-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:data-bridge-depl-2}). Similar estimates were observed in 2021 assessment that included a sensitivity that estimated annual recruitment deviations. 

To arrive at a final base model additional revisions to the model structure, selectivity blocks, and selectivity parameterizations were made in order to determine the best fit to the data.


### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'32_model_structure_assumptions.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```

The southern California model is fit to two fishery-dependent indices of relative abundance: 1) CDFW CRFS onboard observer survey, and 2) CDFW CRFS private/rentals PR1 dockside survey. Additionally, a MRFSS CPFV dockside index was generated but due to data concerns was not included in the base model (lambda adjustment to the likelihood contribution set equal to 0 but retained in the model in order to see implied fits).  The CDFW onboard observer index represents the same recreational party/charter fleet and includes both retained and discarded fish. The onboard index is specified as a separate “survey” fleet in the model because it overlaps in time with the MRFSS dockside time series. The CRFS onboard index uses the recreational  party/charter (CPFV) fleet’s selectivity curve to define vulnerable size classes. The CRFS PR1 dockside index is linked to the recreational private/rental (PR) fleet, and used a different selectivity curve from the party/charter fleet. The indices were assumed to have a lognormal distribution standard error structure.

Recreational length measurements are included as marginal length compositions (numbers at length, sexes combined) by year starting in 1975 and 1980 for the CPFV and PR modes, respectively. Fishery-dependent length composition data are also included for the commercial fleets. Available age data for `r spp` `r area` from either the commercial or recreational fisheries are limited and were only available in 1975 for the recreational CPFV fleet and in 2022 in the commercial dead fleet. Age data from the fisheries were input as marginal ages.

Fishery-independent data sources in the southern California model are organized into three fleets: 1) the `r hkl`, 2) CDFW ROV survey and 3) CCFRP Hook and Line survey. Each of the survey data sources were used to create an index of relative abundance and included marginal length compositions by sex and year. Age data from the `r hkl` and CCFRP Hook and Line survey were included as conditional-age-at-length data by sex and year.  

Additional available age structures that could not be linked to one of the fleets above or represented a subset of information from a fleet were included in the two growth fleets. The `r wcgbt` was not considered for an index of abundance, but is a source of conditional-age-at-length data and associated marginal length comps, both by sex and year, within the `r wcgbt` growth fleet. The second growth fleet combined limited ages from a Pearson Research Study between 2005 - 2007 and ages from the CPFV cooperative collection program in 2022. All composition data were fit with a multinomial error structure.

Time blocks on selectivity were explored extensively when setting up the initial model structure. A range of management changes to the commercial fishery were considered when determining periods when selectivity may have been expected to change. Commercial removals for `r spp` are relatively low when compared to recreational removals for this species which limited the amount of composition data available to support the estimation of changes in selectivity. Given this and the limited evidence in the available length data, time-invariant selectivity was selected for both the commercial dead and live fish fleets. The same time block structure was assumed for both the recreational CPFV and PR fleets based on gear restrictions and depth closures. Selectivity was blocked into three periods: 1916-1999, 2000-2003, and 2004-2022. In 2022 the sub-bag limit in the California recreational fishery was reduced to only allow one `r spp`. However, the amount of length samples in 2022 were not informative about a change in selectivity. The STAT examined depth restrictions in the area `r area` across time to understand the potential selectivity shape by time block for both of the recreational fleets. Since 2004, the majority of depths have been open for recreational anglers (Figure \ref{fig:depth-closures}). However, the PR fleets operating in both CRFS district 1 and 2 and the CPFV fleet out of district 1 have a higher frequency of shorter trips (e.g., half day trips) and given the required travel time to reach the deeper depths within `r spp` range, the number of trips to deeper waters farther from port are likely limited for PR vessels and a portion of the CPFV fleets (see Appendix Section \ref{cpfv-samples} for additional information). Given this, the parameterization of selectivities for both the recreational fleets was allowed to estimate some level of dome-shape. Finally, model exploration revealed that that selectivity in the first and third time blocks (1916-1999 and 2004-2022) for both the CPFV and PR fleets were highly similar so these two time periods were set to have equal selectivity.

A change in selectivity was explored for the `r hkl` between 2012-2014, years where the number of MPA and CCA sites increased within the survey. The selectivity for both time blocks were estimated to be asymptotic or practically asymptotic (very slight dome only at the largest lengths) with little change in model fits to the data (change in negative log-likelihood less than 2 units). In the aim of parsimony, the selectivity for this survey was parameterized to have a single selectivity curve across all years. 

The specification of when to estimate recruitment deviations is an assumption that affects the estimate of early model uncertainty around stock scale and status. Recruitment deviations were estimated from 1880 - 2020 to appropriately quantify uncertainty in the early model years. The earliest length- and age-composition data occur in 1975 but age data were not available consistently on a yearly basis until 2003. The most informed years for estimating recruitment deviations were from about the mid-1990s to 2018. The period from 1880 - 1964 was fit using an early recruitment deviation series with little or no bias adjustment, the main period of recruitment deviates occurred from 1965 - 2020 with an upward and downward ramping of bias adjustment, and 2021 onward recruitment deviations were assumed to be 0 due to limited information at the end of the time series. Methot and Taylor [-@methot_adjusting_2011a] summarize the reasoning behind varying levels of bias adjustment based on the information available to estimate the deviates. The standard deviation of recruitment variability was assumed to be 0.60 based on the estimated variation in recruitment from the base model. Annual recruitment deviations were not forced to be fully zero centered during the main recruitment period in order to allow the data to fully inform the estimation and to avoid this constraint altering the annual estimates. Model explorations revealed that the selection of recruitment deviation estimation, zero-centered or not, had little to no impact on the annual estimated deviations.

filein = file.path(doc_dir, "shared_text",'31_model_priors.Rmd')
read_child(filein)
```


### Data Weighting

Length composition data for the commercial fishery started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in 
Section \ref{commercial-fishery}. The input sample size for the length composition data from recreational fishery was determined based on the number of estimated trips (described in Sections \ref{recreational-fishery}), both the CCFRP and NWFSC Hook and Line surveys were set equal to the number of positive drops by year, the CDFW ROV were set equal to the number of positive transects, the `r wcgbt` was set equal to the number of fish, and the Pearson Research survey and CPFV cooperative collection program set equal to the number of trips. The majority of age-composition data were input as conditional-age-at-length with input sample size equal to the number of ages. The age-composition data from both the commercial dead and historical CPFV samples were used as marginal age-composition with the input sample size set equal to the number of ages.     

The base model was weighted using the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011] which was selected based on model stability and consistency to identify the minimum likelihood estimate (MLE). This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution). Since Francis data weighting is determined by the mean and variance in observations across years, a subset of data types that had only one year of composition data were weighted based on recommended values from the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weight [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997]. These data sources were the marginal ages from the commercial dead and CPFV fleet and the conditional-age-at-length data from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey.

Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in the model fits and results due to weighting using McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting  and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [-@thorson_model-based_2017].

### Model Parameters

There were 186 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 10 parameters for growth, 
5 parameters for extra variability for the fishery and survey indices, 29 parameters for length-based selectivity and time 
blocking of the fleets and the surveys, and 141 recruitment deviations including 35 pre-model estimates (Table \ref{tab:params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, the mean of the prior. A sensitivity analysis and a likelihood profile were performed for steepness. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr^-1^ for females and males, the median of the prior. Estimation of natural mortality was explored during model development. The estimate of natural mortality was uncertain and poorly informed by the data. When estimated, natural mortality was low (around 0.090 yr^-1^), relative to the median of the prior which was based on maximum age; however, well within the prior distribution (SE = 0.31). The observations of fish greater than 50 years of age across the West Coast, not only this assessment area, is rare, so a natural mortality that would be associated with a maximum around 60 years of age did not seem well supported. Natural mortality was fixed in the base model but estimation of this parameter for both sexes was explored via sensitivities.

The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.60 ($\sigma_R$). Maturity-at-length was fixed as described above in Section \ref{maturation-and-fecundity}. A single California sex-specific length-weight relationship was fixed at externally derived estimates using the `r hkl` and `r wcgbt` length-weight observations (Figure \ref{fig:weight-length}).

## Base Model Results

The base model described here is only for the portion of the `r spp` stock in California south of Point Conception.  Descriptions of the summed total biomass, spawning output, and stock status for the full California stock of `r spp` are described in later sections.  

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors (SD column) are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:south-likes}. The estimated data weights by the Francis method are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. Estimates of the `r spp` population size `r area` over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:south-timeseries}. 

The full r4ss plotting output is available in the supplementary material on the [Pacific Fishery Management Council website](pcouncil.org).

### Parameter Estimates

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the externally estimated starting values.  The length-at-age 2 and the length-at-age 20 estimates for both sexes were slightly less than the external estimates but were well within the 95 percent confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:params} and Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The estimated $k$ for females was greater than the values estimated externally using the survey age data while the male value was similar to the external estimate (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for females and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for males).  The majority of female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 10-15, with female `r spp` reaching marginally larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). 

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets. The majority of fishery and survey fleets were parameterized using the double normal selectivity parameterization in SS3 except for the commercial dead and `r hkl` fleets that were parameterized as logistic asymptotic selectivity. The estimated selectivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:est-selex}. The selectivity for the commercial dead fleet was estimated to be asymptotic and constant across the model period. The commercial live fish fishery selects fish at small sizes with dome-shaped selectivity. Both recreational fleets were estimated to have dome-shaped selectivity for each selectivity period with the CPFV fleet selecting a higher portion of large fish in the final time block relative to the PR fleet. The peak in selectivity for both the CPFV and PR fleets in the final time block were estimated at `r round(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters[rownames(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters) == "Size_DblN_peak_Rec_CPFV(3)", "Value"], 1)` and `r round(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters[rownames(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters) == "Size_DblN_peak_Rec_Private(4)", "Value"], 1)`, respectively.  While the recreational fleets select a wide range of sizes, the estimated peaks of selectivity for both fleets were notably less than the size-at-50 percent maturity of 33.7 cm.

The CCFRP Hook and Line and CDFW ROV surveys estimated peak selectivity around 40 cm with selectivity decreasing for larger fish. The `r hkl` estimated asymptotic selectivity only reaching maximum selectivity for the largest fish. The `r wcgbt` which samples soft bottom via trawl gear had relatively low selectivity for the majority of sizes with only selectivity peaking at the largest sizes. Finally, the estimated length-based selectivity from the CPFV cooperative collection and Pearson Research study was asymptotic with full selectivity for fish of 35 cm and larger.  Both of these last two fleets included only lengths and ages to inform growth estimation. As noted in the Growth Data Section \ref{growth-data} that describes these data, the estimated selectivity for the samples collected by the CPFV vessels participating in the cooperative sampling program was distinctly different than that from the CPFV fleet operating `r area` as a whole. This is likely due to the areas accessible and trip type (half-day, three-quarter day, or overnight) between the CRFS districts 1 and 2 within this area where all vessels participating in the collaborative collections operating out of district 2.

The catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. The analytical values for catchability were very small given the survey methodologies and are reported in Table \ref{tab:params} in log-space.  Additional fishery and survey index variability, process error added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the were estimated within the model. The model estimated the largest added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Rec_Private(4)", 3], 3)` for the recreational PR fishery index. In contrast the model estimated only limited additional variability in order to fit the recreational CRFS CPFV fishery index (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CRFS_CPFV(8)", 3], 3)`). The model fit the trends in the `r hkl` index of abundance relatively well with only a small amount of added variance  being estimated to fit this time series (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSC_HKL(7)", 3], 3)`). The model estimated an added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CCFRP(5)", 3], 3)` and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CDFW_ROV(6)", 3], 3)` to the indices from the CCFRP and CDFW ROV surveys, respectively.

The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in 2010 and 2013 with the lowest being estimated in 2018 and 2019. There is limited information regarding recruitment prior to 1980 but are estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the unfished condition. The historical age age data from the CPFV fleet from 1975 were identified to have a disproportional influence on estimated recruitment in the late 1960s relative to all other data sources in the model. These data resulted in a sharp spike in recruitment during these years that was substantially higher than any other year in the model.  Given that these estimates were extreme and appeared to be informed by limited data, the decision was made to reduce the influence of this one year of limited age data for model stability (lambda value of 0.10 for these data). Sensitivities showed that the overall ending model estimates were not impacted by this decision (show below in Sensitivities Section \ref{sensitivities}). Estimated recruitment deviations during the early years when compositional data began, 1975 - 1995, have relatively high uncertainty intervals indicating lack of support for clear strong or poor recruitment years across data sources. Recruitment deviations after 2017 are relatively uncertain but with large negative recruitment deviations. Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in 2021 and 2022  (Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}). The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adjust}.


### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the fishery and survey fleets in the model. Annual length composition fits are shown in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}.  

The aggregated fit to the length composition data by fleet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}. The majority of the length compositions from the commercial dead fleet were unsexed fish with sexed fish only occurring for select years for limited samples (1986, 1987, and 2022). On aggregate the model fit the unsexed length composition well with the single asymptotic selectivity curve. Pearson residuals for the commercial dead fishery length data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-pearson}. The data across time are limited making it difficult to discern patterns in the Pearson residuals across time. Temporal patterns are additionally difficult to discern since the data were not sufficient to support the estimation of time-varying selectivity which would be expected given changes in management. The mean lengths observed by year from the commercial fleet were uncertain but showed a relatively stable mean size in the final years of the model and a larger mean size in the available data prior to 1990 (Figure \ref{fig:com-dead-mean-len-fit}). There were only limited ages available from the commercial dead fleet in 2022 with rather large Pearson residuals (Figures \ref{fig:agg-marg-age-fit} and \ref{fig:com-dead-age-pearson}), noting that there were only 8 ages available that happened to all be female. The Pearson residuals for the commercial live fish fishery did not appear to have patterns or periods of misfit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-pearson}) and the model appeared to fit the mean size across time which was highly variable (Figure \ref{fig:com-live-mean-len-fit}). 

The length composition data aggregated across years from the CPFV fleet was fit well by model (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). The Pearson residuals for the recreational CPFV length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, with observations greater than expected, for larger fish in the earliest data. Additionally, there appears to be a series of diagonal positive residuals moving across years starting around 2005 which may be a year-class moving through the population that the model is under-estimating. These under fits to the data could align with the positive recruitment deviation being estimated in 2003 for the population. Explorations of alternative selectivity forms failed to resolve this pattern in residuals. The mean length observed by the CPFV fleet was fit relatively well by the model with the largest mean size being observed in the early years of the data with the mean size roughly stabilizing between the late 1980s though 2010, after which there was a decline in the mean size, which then slowly increased at the end of the model period (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-mean-len-fit}). Age data were available for the CPFV fleet only in 1975 with all ages being unsexed fish (Figure \ref{fig:agg-marg-age-fit}). The peak of the distribution of these ages was under-fit by the model (Figure \ref{fig:rec-cpfv-age-pearson}). These ages where highly influential in the model, leading to a large recruitment deviation that was significantly higher than any other year estimated. All data weighting approaches explored indicated these data should be significantly up-weighted (e.g., suggested weights of greater than 1.0 where the input sample size was equal to the number of fish). Due to the highly influential nature of this single year these data were down-weighted in the model. Model explorations showed that down-weighting of these data did not effect the ending model estimates but resulted in a more stable model.

The aggregate length composition data from the PR fleet had a slightly higher peak around 30 cm with fewer observations of larger fish relative to the CPFV fleet and was fit well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). The Pearson residuals for the recreational PR length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-pearson}). Similar to the CPFV length data, there appears to be a series of diagonal positive residuals moving across years starting around 2005 which may be a year-class moving through the population that the model is under-estimating and that were not able to be resolved.  The mean length observed by the PR fleet was highly variable prior to 2001 with the model estimated mean length being either below or above the observed mean length (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-mean-len-fit}). After 2001, the variability around the mean length decreases with the model roughly able to fit the decrease in mean length after 2010 and the recent increases in mean length (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pr-mean-len-fit}). 

The CCFRP Hook and Line survey aggregated lengths had a sharp peak between 30-40 cm that the model underestimated but fit the ascending and descending length observations well (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). There was no clear pattern in the Pearson residuals for this data source (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-len-pearson}). The model estimated mean length was increasing between 2017-2021, while the CCFRP data had a declining trend in mean length observed for this period (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-mean-len-fit}). However, the estimated model fit was well within the variance in the observed lengths by this survey and this data source was given an intermediate data weight (Table \ref{tab:dw}). Only a limited number of age data were available in 2022 from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey and were input as conditional-age-at-length data. This data source had a slightly higher proportion of fish observed at small sizes and intermediate ages than the model expectation given the estimated growth (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-age-pearson})

The CDFW ROV survey observed fish of a large size range and was fit well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). Across the five years with available length data there was no clear pattern of model misfit in the Pearson residuals (Figure \ref{fig:rov-pearson}). The mean lengths observed by this survey increased between the two sampling periods (2014-2015 and 2019-2021) and were fit well by the model expectations (Figure \ref{fig:rov-mean-len-fit}).  

The aggregated sexed length composition data from the `r hkl` was fit relatively well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). The Pearson residuals by sex did not show any clear patterns of poor fit (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-pearson}). Notably, there were no patterns of residuals at the larger sizes across sample years indicating that there was not a clear shift in larger fish being observed as the number of MPAs and sites within the CCAs began to be sampled. The trend in mean lengths was fit well by the model with both the data and model showing a decline in mean lengths in the mid-2010s and an increase in mean length in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-mean-len-fit}). The Pearson residuals for the conditional-age-at-length data did not show any clear patterns of poor fits, excluding select positive residuals for single fish observations with length-age combinations (e.g., old-large male in 2012 or older female of intermediate size in 2016, Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-age-pearson-1}-\ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-age-pearson-3}). The pattern in the mean ages is generally fit by the model, except for the 2021, which the model underestimates (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-mean-age-fit}).

The NWFSC WCGBT survey across years selected limited numbers of `r spp` of all sizes with the observations of sexed fish being generally well fit by the model (Figure \ref{fig:len-agg-fit}). The Pearson residuals did not show patterns of poor fit across years with the largest residuals arising for small unsexed fish observed in 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-len-pearson}). The mean size observed across years was generally stable, although data through 2011 had high variability in the observed length, and was fit well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-mean-len-fit}). The conditional-age-at-length data were fit well by the model (Figures \ref{fig:wcgbt-age-pearson-1} and \ref{fig:wcgbt-age-pearson-3}). The mean age across years was fit well by the model with recommended data weights greater than one (i.e., the recommended data weights were capped at one to equal the number of fish, Table \ref{tab:dw} and Figure \ref{fig:wcgbt-mean-age-fit}). 

The Pearson residuals for the Pearson Research and CPFV cooperative collection length data were greatest for the Pearson Research lengths (2005-2007) but the sample sizes across the three years were limited (31 fish total, Figure \ref{fig:coop-len-pearson}). The variance around the mean lengths observed in 2022 was limited but fit well by the model (Figure \ref{fig:coop-mean-len-fit}). The conditional-at-length data from the CPFV cooperative collection were highly variable with positive residuals of smaller than average size-at-age fish compared to other data sources (Figure \ref{fig:coop-age-pearson}). The mean age of 12 for fish observed in 2022 was under-fit by the model (Figure \ref{fig:coop-mean-age-fit}). 

The model estimates generally followed similar trends in both the recreational CFRS CPFV onboard and CRFS PR dockside indices of abundance (Figures \ref{fig:crfs-cpfv-index-fit} and \ref{fig:crfs-pr-index-fit}). The model estimated vulnerable biomass for the CRFS CPFV onboard index follows the observed trend of lower estimates in the beginning of the time series, increasing after 2010, and a subtle decline in the final years of the index. However, the model under-fits select years that increased relative to the surrounding years (e.g., 2007-2008, 2013, and 2018) resulting in the model adding additional variance in order to fit these years. The CRFS PR index of abundance had a similar trend as that of the CRFS CPFV index and was fit well excluding the the 2007-2008 and the 2012 data points which were under and over estimated, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:crfs-pr-index-fit}).

The model estimated a subtle decline at the end of the time series that fit all but one of the years from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey index of abundance (Figure \ref{fig:ccfrp-index-fit}). The model estimated trajectory followed the trend observed in the CDFW ROV survey that began in 2014, before the CCFRP Hook and Line survey in 2017, with final three years of observations in 2019-2021 showing a slight decline (Figure \ref{fig:rov-index-fit}) whereas the CCFRP Hook and Line survey showed an increase over those years. The final survey included in the model was the `r hkl` and the longest fishery-independent time series included in the model. The fit the overall trend of the index well, excluding the 2005 and 2006 data points that were higher than the surrounding years (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-index-fit}).

### Population Trajectory in the Modeled Area

The predicted spawning output for the portion of the stock `r area` is given in Table \ref{tab:south-timeseries} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output time series shows a slow decline in spawning output from the 1960sthrough the mid-1970s as catches ramped up (Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The predicted spawning output sharply decreases until the early 1990s around when catches started to decline from their peak. The spawning output stabilized at low levels through the early 2000s when the population slowly began to slightly increase up until the final years of the model when spawning output is declining. The estimated total biomass follows the same general trend as observed in the spawning output but with a more pronounced increase between the early 2000s up until 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}). The estimated spawning output relative to the unfished equilibrium spawning output for the sub-area `r area` has remained relatively low between since the late 1980s, peaking in recent years at 0.20 in 2018 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}).

## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered using the jitter function built into Stock Synthesis, using a jitter input of 0.10. This was repeated 100 times with 17 out of 100 runs returning to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. In the jittering analysis, models with similar log-likelihood values (difference < 0.50 units) were often found with little difference in overall model estimates indicating a somewhat flat likelihood surface around the maximum likelihood estimate. Additionally, jitters using a smaller jitter value yielded an increased frequency of runs returning to the base model with no models finding a better fit to the data. Through the jittering done as explained and the likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model, as presented, represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

### Sensitivity Analyses {#sensitivities}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the relative influence of specific changes to data inputs and model structural assumptions to further address uncertainty associated with the base model estimates and derived management quantities. The majority of the sensitivity models are the result of a single change relative to base model (i.e., they are not the result of cumulative changes such as the modeling approach used with the bridging analysis). Comparisons of likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from the sensitivity analyses are shown in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}-\ref{tab:sensitivities-3}. Comparison of all sensitivities relative to the base model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sens-all} with Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1}-\ref{fig:sens-depl-3} showing the change in spawning output and the relative spawning output trajectories. Many additional sensitivity runs were explored during development and testing of the base model. This section focuses on the main data and structural sensitivity model runs and includes the following:

Structural Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item  Estimate natural mortality ($M$) for each sex.
  
  \item Estimate steepness ($h$).
  
  \item Estimate $M$ for each sex and $h$.
  
  \item Fix recruitment to be equal to the stock-recruitment curve (no recruitment deviations).
  
  \item Set the CPFV selectivity to be asymptotic for the period of 2004-2022.
  
  \item Apply Dirichlet data weights.
  
  \item Apply McAllister-Ianelli data weights.

\end{enumerate}

Data Sensitivities

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Reduce the PR catch between 1970-1982 to half of the fleet's average catch for that period of time.
  
  \item Eliminate down weighting of the historical CPFV ages (lambda = 1.0).
  
  \item Remove all age data and fix growth at the estimates.
  
  \item Remove the CPFV cooperative collection ages in 2022.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC WCGBT survey lengths and ages.
  
  \item Add the NWFSC WCGBT index of abundance.
  
  \item Remove all fishery-dependent indices of abundance.
  
  \item Remove the CCFRP Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the CDFW ROV survey data (index and lengths).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey data (index, lengths, and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey age data only.
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey length and age data (retain only the index of abundance).
  
  \item Move NWFSC Hook and Line survey data prior to the sampling expansion to include CCAs in 2014 to be associated with the Pearson Research Cooperative Collection growth fleet. This approach has been applied in other assessments where the expansion into the CCA were thought to impact the size and age of fish being encountered by the survey. 
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line survey index of abundance (retain the lengths and ages).
  
  \item Remove the NWFSC Hook and Line, CCFRP Hook and Line, and CDFW ROV survey data (indices, lengths, and ages).

\end{enumerate}

Across all the sensitivities conducted only a subset resulted in distinct changes in the model estimates and the discussion here will focus on the sensitivities that were identified in Figure \ref{fig:sens-all}. The sensitivity that did not estimate annual recruitment deviations and predicted recruitment directly from the stock-recruitment curve resulted in the model estimating a higher initial unfished recruitment ($R_0$), a higher spawning output in the final model year, and a less depleted stock (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). The dynamics of `r spp` `r area` appear to be highly driven by strong or weak recruitment variations combined with exploitation. In order to fit the data in the absence of recruitment variation the model needs to adjust the derived quantities accordingly.  

Both sensitivities that explored the impact of alternative data weighting methodologies resulted in differences relative to the base model in derived final spawning output and relative spawning output (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). The suggested data weights from the Dirichlet methodology for most data types hit the upper bound on data-weighting of 1.0 (Table \ref{tab:dw}). These suggested data weights for the length data may be due to the input sample sizes not being equal to the number of fish sampled and if the data processing were revised, the suggested data weights may be less than those estimated here. However, the Dirichlet data weighting approach also estimated data weights at the upper bound of 1.0 for the majority of age data sources which in most instances had an input sample size equal to the number of fish. Similar behavior in data weights suggested by the Dirichlet method have been encountered across other sensitivities for previous assessments (e.g. petrale sole in 2019, copper rockfish in 2021). In order to understand what is behind this behavior, additional simulation work should be conducted to inform how this approach should be applied.  The other data weighting approach, McAllister-Ianelli, also estimated a higher final spawning output and relative status compared to the base model (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). Much of the exploratory modeling work conducted for this assessment used either Francis or McAllister-Ianelli. Models that used the McAllister-Ianelli data-weighting for `r spp` `r area` seemed to generally have issues converging to the true maximum likelihood estimate (MLE, e.g., jitter commonly identified a model with a lower MLE) with this issue also extending to challenges when conducting likelihood profiles. These issues pertained to this sensitivity run where running diagnostics for this sensitivity revealed an inability of the MLE being repeatedly identified (i.e., out of 100 jitters run at a level of 0.10, only one run returned to the true MLE) and likelihood parameter profiles that failed to converge to a reasonable model across the profiled parameter values.

The model showed sensitivity to a range of data sources (Figure \ref{fig:sens-all}). Removing the length and age data from the `r wcgbt` resulted in a larger estimate of final spawning output and a less depleted population (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-2}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). These data had a number of observations from age-0 and age-1 `r spp` and when removed from the model the size-at-age 2 increased for female fish relative to the base model resulting in a meaningful change in the growth curve. Removing both CRFS CPFV and PR indices of abundance from the model also resulted in the sensitivity estimating a larger final spawning  output (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-2}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The majority of the indices included in the model included a slight downturn at the end of the time series (Figure \ref{fig:stand-cpue}) indicating that each of these indices have some level of contribution to the estimates at the end of the time series.  

The base model was most sensitive to the removal of the `r hkl` data (i.e., indices, lengths, and ages, Figure \ref{fig:sens-all}). The `r hkl` is the only major data source in the model that had asymptotic selectivity (i.e., the commercial dead fleet selectivity was also asymptotic but given the low removals was not a influential fleet in the model (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-3}, Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-3} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-3}). Removing all data from this survey allows the model to estimate a lower size-at-age 20 for both male and female fish which may allow the model to estimate a less depleted population given the differences in the composition data. Explorations that removed the age data from this survey indicated that the change in model estimates relative to the base model are largely being driven by the age-composition data from this survey. 

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by successively removing years of data ranging from 2017 - 2021 (i.e., “Data -1 Years” corresponds to data through 2021). The estimated spawning output for all retrospectives was higher at the start of the time series and lower for the final model years (Figure \ref{fig:retro-ssb}). There are a significant number of ages only available in 2022 leading to this slight decline in estimated spawning output when the most recent data were removed. Additionally, removing five years of data completely removes all data from the CCFRP Hook and Line survey and a majority of the data point from the CDFW ROV survey.  The estimates of relative spawning output to unfished decreased with each subsequent data peel compared to the base model but were within the uncertainty intervals  (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}).

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, and sex-specific natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimating the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

The negative-log-likelihood was minimized at a log($R_0$)value of `r round(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters[rownames(model$estimated_non_dev_parameters) == "SR_LN(R0)", "Value"], 2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The likelihood profile for $R_0$ was most informed by the recruitment likelihood contribution within the model. The information about $R_0$ across the other data sources was limited with the age data having the greatest information supporting lower values of $R_0$. Across the range of log($R_0$) values profiled the spawning output at the end of the time series were similar with the largest differences occurring around the estimates of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb}). The varying estimates of unfished spawning output across values of log($R_0$) translated to variations in the ending population status (11-22 percent), although all of the profile trajectories ended in a similar depleted range as the base model (Figure \ref{fig:r0-depl}).  

The majority of data types included in the model contained limited information on steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). The minimum identified by the profile of approximately 0.69, was very similar to the fixed value in the model (0.72) based on the mean of the prior but values between approximately 0.60-0.80 had similar support from the data. The sensitivity that explored estimating steepness indicated little to no change in the negative-log-likelihood relative to the base model that fixes this parameter (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}). Similar to the profile over log($R_0$), fixing steepness in the model at values ranging between 0.30-0.95 had the largest impact on the derived unfished spawning output resulting in a range of relative spawning outputs between 12-23 percent of unfished for the sub-area `r area` (Figures \ref{fig:h-ssb} and \ref{fig:h-depl}).

Parameter profiles across a range of female natural mortality values indicated that the negative-log-likelihood was minimized around values below the model fixed value of 0.108 yr^-1^ (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The length data were the most informative around this parameter with the length data from the CDFW ROV and NWFSC Hook and Line surveys contributing the most information about natural mortality. The information in the age data by source was more limited but the aggregate information across data sources supported values greater than 0.09 yr^-1^. Relative to the other parameter profiles the assumed value of female natural mortality had a reduced impact on the estimates of spawning output and the relative status (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb}-\ref{fig:m-depl}). The range of relative spawning output at the end of the time series was between 8-16 percent of unfished spawning output across natural mortality values between 0.08-0.12 yr^-1^. 

Throughout model explorations estimates of both steepness and natural mortality were made. A decision to not estimate these parameters in the base model was based on the change in the negative-log-likelihood of only 1.5 units when the three additional parameters were estimated.  Additionally, these parameters were not well informed by the data and appeared to lead to issues with the model correctly identifying the best fit to the data.

### Historical Analysis

The estimated spawning output from both the 2013 and 2021 assessments for the portion of `r spp` `r area` compared to the base model are shown in Figures \ref{fig:comp-assess-sb} and \ref{fig:comp-assess-depl}. The model structure and the approach used in the 2013, index-based data-moderate assessment using Extended-Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis, was significantly different both from the 2021 and this assessment. While the estimates from the 2013 model were converted to spawning output for this comparison, the assumed growth, maturity, and selectivity in that assessment resulted in a significantly larger estimate of spawning output with a less depleted population. The estimated scale of the population and relative fraction of spawning output among the 2021 and this base model were consistent despite the number of additional data sources, changes in biology (estimated vs. fixed at external estimates), and recruitment dynamics (estimation of annual recruitment deviations in the base model which fixed to 0 in the 2021 assessment).

A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).

Trips recorded with a primary area fished in Mexico or in bays, e.g., 
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
For indices representing only north of Point Conception, the years 1993-1994 were 
excluded due to limited spatial coverage.

The Stephens-MacCall [-@stephens_multispecies_2004] filtering approach was used to predict the 
probability of catching copper rockfish, based 
on the species composition of the sampler examined catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative 
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage 
(present in at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model.  The remaining 
 xx species all co-occurred with copper rockfish in at least one trip 
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients 
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species that are more likely to co-occur with copper rockfish, 
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with copper rockfish 
(Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sm-mrfss)).
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with copper rockfish include
copper, greenspotted, bocaccio, and olive rockfishes and ocean whitefish, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp 
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were 
kelp bass, Pacific bonito, white croaker, California sheephead, and barred sandbass.

While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species 
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of 
more than one species or species complex ("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall [-@stephens_multispecies_2004] proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index 
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives 
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch 
a copper rockfish based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False 
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a copper rockfish, given the 
catch composition, but caught at least one. The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives" of 0.31. The 
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method 
including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability of 
encountering copper rockfish. 
This assumes that if copper rockfish were caught, the anglers must have fished in 
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is 
"sampler-examined" and the samplers are well trained in species identification.


The threshold probability that balances FP and FN excludes 
5383 trips that did not catch a copper rockfish (84% 
of the trips), and 308 trips (5% of the data) that 
caught a copper rockfish. We retained the latter set of trips (FN), assuming that 
catching a copper rockfish indicates that a non-negligible fraction of the fishing 
effort occurred in habitat where copper rockfish occur. Only “true negatives” 
(the 5383 
trips that neither caught copper rockfish, nor were predicted to catch them by the model) 
were excluded from the index standardization. The final dataset selected included 
1043 trips, 70% 
of which encountered copper rockfish.  Sample sizes by the factors selected to model are in Tables 
\@ref(tab:tab-region-mrfss) and \@ref(tab:tab-year-mrfss).


Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be 
ill-fitting. The proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial 
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that 
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch 
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) with a Bayesian delta-GLM model. 
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore <3 nm, offshore >3 nm) 
factors were evaluated. For assessments north of Point Conception, two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte 
to Santa Cruz ("N") and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo ("C"). For assessment models south 
of Point Conception, the region represents individual counties. Note that Santa Barbara 
county spans north and south of Point Conception, but all accessible fishing ports in Santa Barbara county are south of Point Conception and vessels rarely (if ever) transit Point Conception.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-areacpue-mrfss)). 


The positive observations were modeled with a Lognormal distribution 
that was selected over a Gamma model
by a $\Delta AIC$ of 51.8, and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-dist-fits-mrfss)).  The delta-GLM
method allows selection of differing linear predictors between the binomial and positive models. Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits,

\@ref(tab:onboard-filter). The onboard CPFV index restricts the time series to 2005-2019. The onboard observer survey 
began in 1999, but the sample sizes were small during the first year of the program. The 
years 1999-2004 also represent years where a number of regulations changed including gear limits, 
bag limits, and spatial closures.  Due to COVID-19, no onboard sampling took place in 2020. In 2021, the onboard sampling resumed in August, at which point a large portion of the southern California fleet had switched target species to fish highly migratory species. The 2021 stock assessment for `r spp` had also been released by August 2021 indicating the portion of the population south of Point Conception was depleted, estimated to be below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished.  The southern California CPFV fleet began an organized effort to avoid copper rockfish and encourage their clientele to release and descend copper rockfish when encountered. In 2022, the CDFW implemented the one copper rockfish sub-bag limit and combined with avoidance by the fleet, the data in this year does not represent the available copper rockfish biomass. 

The data filters also included the removal of the number of observed anglers and time fished at the tail ends of the distributions, and removal of drifts occurring in depths outside the expected range of copper rockfish (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-filter) and Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-depths)). The availability of high resolution data were lacking for the area south of Point Conception, hence, we retained all drifts from within a CDFW block that had at least 100 drifts and at least 5 percent of those encountered copper rockfish. A total of 17,605 drifts were retained for index standardization with 3,035 of those drifts encountered copper rockfish (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-percentpos). 

In the assessment model, the recreational CPFV fleet is modeled as retained plus discarded fish. The proportion of observed discarded copper rockfish is small, averaging 4 percent over the time series (\@ref(tab:onboard-keepdiscard)) and are included in the index. We modeled catch per angler minutes fished (CPUE) by fishing drift. Prior to any modeling, the SWFSC QA/QC'd the data to ensure the location information was correct. Each drift was overlaid in ArcPro with the available interpreted substrate layer that characterizes rocky and hard substrate, assigned to a rocky reef and the distance of the drift start location calculated. In addition, the depth of the start location was interpreted from the 2 m resolution bathymetry as well as 90 m resolution bathymetry layer for comparison. For drifts missing depth location, we assigned depth based on the best available depth based on the bathymetry.

To appropriately weight the onboard observer survey index by the available 
rocky substrate within a region, each drift was assigned to the closest area 
of rocky habitat. Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
along the mainland coast of southern California. These data 
were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters, but did not extend into state waters 
past the mainland coast. Additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as 
rock or soft bottom were compiled by analysts at the University of California Santa Cruz and are now
also available from CDFW's website. We used the available interpreted rocky substrate data to expand the 
known area of rocky substrate to areas in southern California that lack substrate type.  This 
expansion of the estimated rocky substrate assumes that the proportions of rocky substrate within 
and outside state waters are similar. Copper rockfish are a nearshore species and the majority of 
observed encounters were within state waters (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-waterarea)). This is, of course, an estimation of the amount of rocky substrate, and represents the best available data. The calculations can be found in the online supplementary material.

The covariates explored for model selection included year and four categorical region levels (District 1 mainland, District 2 mainland, Southern Channel Islands and Northern Channel Islands), a year and area interaction, a categorical variable for month, and continuous depth and depth-squared. Trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set (Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-regioncpue)). A year and region interaction 
was included after visualizing the trends in average CPUE over time. The full model was selected by AICc 
(Table \@ref(tab:onboard-modelselect)). In southern California, whether a trip is a half-day or three-quarter-day or overnight trip has a significant impact on the available fishing grounds.  The half-day CPFV vessels fish in the shallower, nearshore waters along the along the mainland coast. The three-quarter and overnight or multi-day
vessels are able to access the same areas of the Northern Channel Islands, where as the southern Channel Islands 
are further offshore and the observations are predominantly from overnight trips. The overnight and 
multi-day trips may target multiple target species, i.e., tuna and rockfish, depending on the time of the year.

Indices were fit via MLE from the sdmTMB package in R. The Q-Q plot for the negative binomial 
model indicated a poor fit to the data, which as not surprising given the low percent of observed drifts encountering copper rockfish. A delta-lognormal error distribtuion was selected over a delta-gamma based on AIC.  The Q-Q plot indicated a much improved fit compared to the negative binomial model (Table \@ref(fig:onboard-qq)).

The final index was weighted based on the estimates of rocky substrate within each of the four regions. 
The relative abundance increases during the first part of the time series (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-index) 
and Figure \@ref(fig:onboard-index)).

## CRFS PR Dockside Index of Abundance {#crfs-pr-index}

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2022, 
were provided by CDFW for use in this assessment. The PR dockside data housed 
on the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN) were 
determined to include a number of complexities that precluded the ability to 
use them for the development of an index of abundance. For the time period from 2004-2014 the STAT 
re-created the interview, or trip level, data from the "i" sample files. For 2015-2022 
the STAT used files provided by CDFW from the CRFS dockside sampling program.

The data for both time periods included catch by species, number of anglers contributing to the catch, angler-reported area of fishing, gear, county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. The catch included 
the number of fish observed by the CRFS sample, the number of unobserved retained fish reported 
by the angler, and the number of discarded and descended fish reported by the angler.
The sample size of the unfiltered private boat data is much larger than the CPFV onboard observer data set, 
with 256,738 samples statewide from 2004-2022, 169,912 south of Point Conception and 86,826 north of Point Conception. 

Records were limited to the primary private and rental boats public-access sites, PR1 sites, which encompasses over 90 percent of the total private boat effort (Table \@ref(tab:pr-filter)). The CRFS interviews contain a small fraction 
(407 trips over the entire time series) of samples where the retained catch for rockfish is over the daily bag limit of 10 fish per person. We did not remove these data from the index, but did only include sampler examined catch. Rockfish species can be difficult to distinguish and there have not been any verification studies conducted to determine the uncertainty in angler reported unobserved catch. Additional data filters included the exclusion of any samples from January and February, since those months have been closed to the recreational fishery south of Point 
Conception since 2005.  The time series was also restricted to 2004-2019. Sampling during the COVID-19 period (2020-2021) resulted in a higher fraction of the sampler examined catch in the "rockfish, general" category due to the social distancing requirements (Table \@ref(tab:pr-rfgen)). The CDFW implemented a one fish sub-bag limit for copper rockfish in 2022 and the quantiles and distribution of CPUE suggest that this regulation change impacted fishing behavior in the private boat fleet (Table \@ref(tab:pr-cpue) and Figure \@ref(fig:pr-bag)).

The angler reported water area was restricted to ocean areas in U.S. waters and a reported primary gear 
of hook and line or troll gear.  A number of trips reporting troll as the primary gear reported
a secondary gear of hook and line. To determine if the angler(s) interviewed targeted rockfish and
fished in rocky habitat, we retained trips if the angler reported the primary target species 
as rockfish or bottomfish or if rockfish was reported as the secondary target species. This filter 
replaced the Stephens-MacCall [@stephens_multispecies_2004] filtering approach that have been used for some assessment in the past. This filtering retained 13,340 angler interviews for index standardization, with 3,739 including sampled examined copper rockfish (Table \@ref(tab:pr-filter)).  

We modeled retained catch per angler days with a negative binomial genearlized linear model in the R package sdmTMB.
The Q-Q plots indicate a reasonable fit (Figure \@ref(fig:pr-qq)).  There are a handful of samples 
with higher than average CPUE and the authors checked with CDFW to determine whether the samples should still be included. CDFW indicated data sheets were not available prior to 2012, but the catches were less than 
the bag limits, and should be assumed to be correct. Indices with a year and district interaction were not 
considered in model selection due to the fact that fishing locations are unknown; the scale of the relative 
abundance of copper rockfish is higher in District 2, but there is some overlap in the fishing locations accessed 
by this fleet (Figure \@ref(fig:pr-districtcpue)). 

Based on AICc values from maximum likelihood fits (Table \@ref(tab:pr-modelselect)), a main effects model including year, month and primary target species as categorical covariates was selected (Table \@ref(tab:pr-index) and Figure \@ref(fig:pr-index)).

## CCFRP Index of Abundance {#ccfrp-index}

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, [CCFRP](https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/), 
is a fishery-independent hook and line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling locations both inside and adjacent to MPAs [@starr_variation_2015a; @wendt_collaborative_2009].  The CCFRP survey began in 2007 along the central coast of California and was designed in collaboration with academics, NMFS scientists and fishermen. From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored four MPAs consistently. In 2017, the CCFRP expanded coastwide within California. The University of California Santa Barbara and Scripps Institute of Oceanography conduct the southern California CCFRP sampling and monitor MPA and reference paired sites.

The survey design for CCFRP consists 500 x 500 m cells both within and  adjacent to each MPA. On any given survey day site cells are randomly selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells). CPFVs are chartered 
for the survey and the fishing captain is allowed to search within the cell for 
a fishing location. During a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 
30-45 minutes by volunteer anglers. Each fish encountered is recorded, measured, and released (or descended to depth)
and can later be linked back to a particular angler. CCFRP samples shallower depths to avoid barotrauma-induced mortality. Starting in 2017, a subset of fish have been retained to collect otoliths and fin clips that provide needed biological information for nearshore species. For the index of abundance, CPUE was modeled at the level of the drift, similar to the fishery-dependent onboard observer survey described above.

The CCFRP data are quality controlled at the time they are key punched and little 
filtering was needed for the index. Cells not consistently sampled over time were 
excluded as well as cells that never encountered `r spp`. Copper rockfish were observed 
at the South La Jolla, Carrington Point and and Anacapa Island MPAs in the area south of Point Conception. After applying filters to remove drfits from sites that were not consistently sampled, marked for exclusion in the data, or did not fish a minimum of two minute, 856 drifts remained for for index standardization, with 399 drifts encountering `r spp`. 

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour). Plots of the average CPUE inside (MPA) and outside (REF) MPAs at each site  are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-avg-cpue). The average CPUE at Carrington Point, the location with the highest CPUE for the survey, from inside and outside MPAs by distinct show a trend of decreasing average CPUE during the time series. Trends among the two other paired sampling locations, Anacapa Island and South La Jolla, had much lower estimated CPUEs with potentially decreasing CPUE for the reference locations and potentially the MPA site at South La Jolla,
On average, across all sampling locations south of Point Conception, the trends in average CPUE over the six year time series inside and outside of the MPA both show a decline in copper rockfish observations. 

A negative binomial model was fit to the drift-level data (catch with a log offset for angler 
hours) using the sdmTMB R package. Because the average observed CPUE among the MPAs indicated differing trends, we explore a region:year interaction, which was not significant. The model selected by AICc included depth, 
depth squared, region and MPA or reference site (Table \@ref(tab:ccfrp-model-selection)), The final model included
year, mpa/reference categorization, depth, depth squared, and a year:mpa/reference interaction. The Q-Q plots indicate a reasonable fit (Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-qq)). The final index (Table \@ref(tab:ccfrp-index)) represents a similar trend to the unstandardized average CPUE (Figure \@ref(fig:ccfrp-index)).


Based on work completed at the SWFSC, we estimated that the percent of rocky reef habitat 
from Point Conception to the California/Mexican border within state waters is 
892 $km^2$, of which approximately 23 percent is in MPAs that prohibit the harvest of 
groundfish (pers comm. Rebecca Miller, UCSC). There is recreational fishing outside 
of state waters, but habitat maps are not available at the same 2-m resolution and do 
not allow for direct comparisons. To estimate the area of rocky substrate south of Point Conception, we separated the southern California Bight into four areas, 1) CRFS District 1 along the mainland coast, 2) CRFS District 2 along the mainland coast, 3) state waters encompassing the southern Channel Islands, and 4) state waters encompassing the northern Channel Islands. We calculated the total area in each of the four regions, as well as the total area with available interpreted substrate. By also calculating the total area open and closed to fishing, i.e., MPAs and CCAs, we expanded the known fraction of rocky substrate to the areas within state waters where no substrate interpreted maps exist.  This resulted in an estimate of 27 percent of the available rocky substrate within areas closed to fishing in southern California state waters.

## NWFSC Hook and Line Index of Abundance {#nwfsc-hkl-model}

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-map}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the `r hkl` are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion/sunset (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008]. 

Over time, select sampling sites in the original survey design have been converted to either federal or state MPAs begining around 2011. Additionally, the survey began sampling in two cowcod conservation areas (CCA) in the California Bight starting in 2014 which has portions of depth where take is prohibited. The data were examined for potential impact of catch rates of `r spp` in the `r hkl` between open and protected areas in order to best understand how to model these data. The catch-per-unit-effort of `r spp` was calculated for protected and open sites in three regions: mainland, Northern Channel Island, and Southern Channel Island (Figure \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-index-raw}). An exploratory negative binomial model determined that the catch rates of `r spp` between open and protected areas were not significantly different so the decision was made to use all data for `r spp` to generate an index of abundance in a manner that did not specifically account for open and protected sites. 

The sites considered for the creation of a relative index of abundance were limited to sites that have caught at least 1 `r spp` across all years. To appropriately weight the survey index by the available rocky substrate by region in the California Bight, each site was assigned as mainland, Northern Channel Island, or Southern Channel Island. Estimates of hard bottom were extracted from the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html) for each of these regions. These data were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters. South of Point  Conception, additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as rock or soft bottom were compiled by Emily Saarman (University of California Santa Cruz) and also available  from CDFW's website. The estimates of rocky substrate for each of these regions were 19.5, 36.5, and 44.1 percent in the mainland, Southern Channel Islands, and Northern Channel Islands, respectively. 

A range of alternative model structures were explored to generate an index of abundance. This included alternative levels of aggregation (hook, drop, or site), probability distributions (negative binomial, delta-gamma, or delta-lognormal), and covariates (year, site, depth, swell height, region, year-region interaction, and/or the number of vermilion/sunset or bocaccio rockfishes observed, Table \ref{tab:nwfsc-hkl-model-select}). The overall trends in the index of abundance were highly similar across the explored probability distributions and model configurations. Based on Q-Q plots, residuals, and AIC the delta-lognormal distribution was selected for the final model using sdmTMB with covariates for year, region, drop, polynomial depth term, number of bocaccio, number of vermilion, year-region interaction, and site as a random-effect [@anderson_sdmtmb_2022] (Figures \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-qq}, \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-resid-1}, and \ref{fig:nwfsc-hkl-resid-2}).

### CDFW ROV Index of Abundance {#cdfw-rov-index}

```

Minimal filtering was done to the data. Transects were removed based on four factors: 1) extreme estimates of effort (the estimated area of view below the ROV termed usable area), 2) any sites that were not visited multiple years, 3) transects that crossed from MPA into reference areas, and 4) transects conducted across depths that never observed `r spp` within the survey (Table \ref{tab:rov-filtered}). Once the data were filtered the average calculated CPUE for each of the MPA and Reference groups were plotted to visualize the data (Table \ref{tab:rov-obs} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-raw-cpue}).

A range of alternative model structures were explored to generate an index of abundance including alternative error structures, covariates, and factors. Based on model selection a model where the numbers of fish observed were predicted by year, site designation (MPA or Reference), proportion soft terrain, year/site designation interaction, and random effect for the year/site interaction was selected (Table \ref{tab:rov-model-selection}). The site indicates the area of the sample where most sites included samples by MPA and reference designations. A delta-gamma model was selected based on the distribution of the data and diagnostics (Figures \ref{fig:rov-qq} and \ref{fig:rov-resids}) using sdmTMB [@anderson_sdmtmb_2022]. 

The model estimates were then area-weighted based on the estimated percent of habitat within MPAs and areas open to fishing. The area estimates were based on existing seafloor mapping data. Unfortunately, all areas `r area` have not been fully mapped for habitat structure. The STAT along with Rebecca Miller (SWFSC/University of California Santa Cruz) used existing seafloor mapping within state waters off the southern California coast to interpret the area of rocky habitat within three regions: mainland, southern Channel Islands, and northern Channel Islands. Within each region the fraction of interpreted rocky substrate area and the rocky substrate area within MPAs and CCAs were estimated. The area estimates by region and inside/outside MPAs and CCAs were extrapolated to provide estimates of unmapped seafloor within each region. The estimates by region were then combined to provide estimates of 73 percent of rocky habitat open to fishing with 27 percent within MPAs and CCAs. The weighted relative index of abundance is shown in Table \ref{tab:rov-index} and Figure \ref{fig:rov-index}.

# CPFV Fleet Description, Sampling, and Trip Types  {#cpfv-samples}

During the 2021 copper rockfish stock assessment meeting and during the pre-assessment workshop for the 2023 groundfish assessments, concern was raised regarding possible biases in the available data by trip types. This appendix describes the sampling and available data from two recent years as an example of the relationship between the available data and catches for copper rockfish.

CDFW conducts several surveys are part of the CRFS program, including an onboard observer survey, angler interviews, and a required CPFV logbook for each trip. The [CRFS sampling manual](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=62348&inline) outlines the sampling methodologies for each survey component.  The state of California allows the filleting of fish at sea; to accurately identify rockfish to species and obtain measurements of whole fish the majority of angler interviews occur onboard the vessel for the CPFV fleet.  The CPFV fleet is not required to speciate the catch and only one block number is recorded per entry. For this reasons the CPFV logbook data are rarely used to develop an index of abundance for groundfish species. However, the CPFV logbook data provide insight into the spatial distribution of fishing effort.

The [California Fisheries Recreational FIsheries Survey Methods](https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=36136&inline) indicates the CPFV "sampling goal is to sample onboard at the historical sampling frequency of two to five percent of estimated CPFV trips of interest (e.g., trips targeting groundfish, inshore and coastal pelagic species) at each CPFV landing and to sample other CPFV trip types dockside." California is divided into six regions for the CRFS sampling, and these represent the finest stratification for catch and effort estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:crfs-districts)).  

The CPFV fleet north and south of Point Conception are fundamentally different in terms of the vessels fishing, available target species, and also fishery regulations over the past twenty years. The CPFVs north of Point Conception targeting groundfish do not typically target other species on the same trip, with the exception being a half-day bottomfish trip mixed with a half-day of Dungeness crab pot fishing. The fleet north of Bodega Bay California is dominated by smaller 6-pack vessels with limited capacity.  It may not be possible for a sampler to ride onboard a 6-pack vessel if the vessel is at capacity. Overnight trips are extremely rare in northern California. In addition, it's important to note that even though Santa Barbara spans Point Conception, all of the fish are landed in San Luis Obispo county in District 3. 

In southern California, the diversity of target species is higher an includes several bass species, state managed gamefish, coastal pelagics, and highly migratory species, as well as boats that fish in Mexican waters. The trip types in southern California include half-day trips where a CPFV will run two trips a day, three-quarter day trips to fishing grounds further offshore, such as the Channel Islands, and overnight trips that can access areas like San Nicholas in the southern Channel Island or may be combination trips fishing for tunas, but also catching rockfish limits. The diversity of trip types and mixed target trips in southern California pose a challenge for both sampling and managing the fisheries.

We filtered the CPFV logbook data to trips that recorded at least one rockfish and the CPFV onboard observer data to trips that encountered at least 1 percent groundfish species. We aggregated within each dataset across 2018 and 2019 and areas where necessary to ensure confidentiality requirements were met. The tables below represent an aggregation of data from 2018 and 2019 combined as they are the two years pre-COVID that best represent the CPFV fleet's activity. We extracted data from the CPFV logbook data and the onboard observer sampled trips to describe the differences in portion of trips sampled and the distribution of copper rockfish catches. In the CPFV logbooks, 60 trips were recorded as multi-day trips in northern California. This represented less then 1 percent of the trips in northern California and we did not investigate the accuracy of these entries. Approximately 6 percent of the logbooks from District 1 recorded a block number in Mexican waters as the primary location fished. Fewer than 10 trips that recorded block numbers along the mainland of southern California were recorded a multi-day trips.  These were removed from the tables below. 

The combined onboard observer sampling rate for 2018-2019 was 3 percent of all CPFV trips in the data used. There were no trips observed onboard in CRFS District 5 during 2018-2019, but 1,052 CPFV logbook records were submitted that recorded at least one rockfish. Grouping the districts by north and south of Point Conception, 2 percent of all trips in northern California were sampled onboard (Table \ref{tab:percent-observed}). In southern California, 4 percent of single day trips were observed and less than 1 percent of multi-day trips were observed.

We broke the data in southern California down further to explore sampling effort by trip type, and assigned a CPFV logbook entry to a region based on the recorded block number (Table \@ref(tab:logbook-triptype)). The offshore region was a catch-all that included blocks outside the range of a half-day trip, but not within the vicinity of an island. In CRFS District 1, 79 percent of the observed trips were half-day day trips, which can access the District 1 mainland. In District 2, 29 percent of the observed trips were half-day day trips. The vessels in District 2 typically offer fewer half-day day trips and fish the nearshore when weather precludes crossing the channel to the northern Channel Islands.

To put these sampling rates in context for copper rockfish, we explored the total estimated mortality related to the distribution of sampling. The total mortality of copper rockfish in metric tons from 2018-2019 from the CPFV fleet by CRFS District is in Table \@ref(tab:catch-example). Fifty-two percent of the total copper rockfish mortality was from northern California and 48 percent from southern California.  Within northern California, 50 percent of the total mortality originated from District 3, and in southern California, 81 percent of the total mortality originated from District 2. 

From the onboard observer trips in District 1, 37 percent of the observed coppers were from half-day day trips, 42 percent from three-quarter to full day trips, and 21 percent of the observed copper rockfish were from the five observed multi-day trips (Table \@ref(tab:onboard-coppers)). 

In District 2, 17 percent of the observed copper were from half-day day trips, 75 percent from the three-quarter to full day trips and 8 percent from overnight trips. When weather allows, the northern Channel Islands can be accessed from CRFS District 2 during a three-quarter to full day trip or a multi-day trip, depending on the port. For instance, the CPFVs from Oxnard, California access the northern Channel Island during multi-day trips, and the same areas are accessed by the three-quarter to full day boats out of Santa Barbara Landing.

## Information Provided by the Commercial and Recreational Fleet Representatives


The copper rockfish STAT held the following three informal virtual meetings with stakeholders as part of the data exploration process:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Copper Rockfish and the Commercial Fisheries on January 10, 2023 (24 attendees)
  \item Copper Rockfish and the Recreational Fishery South of Point Conception on January 23, 2023 (17 attendees)
  \item Copper Rockfish and the Recreational Fishery North of Point Conception on January 30, 2023 (19 attendees)
  
\end{enumerate}


A summary of the information learned from these meetings is provided here. We would like to thank everyone who participated in our virtual meetings for their willingness to participate in the stock assessment process and provided additional insight into the fisheries for copper rockfish.

### Preferred Habitat and Life History Notes

Copper rockfish are "king" of the reef and appear to push other species off of the best habitat within a reef. The STAT consistently heard from all fishermen that copper rockfish are not caught in areas of high relief. Copper rockfish prefer areas of flatter or broken hard bottom, and also venture out over soft bottom habitat. It is often larger fish caught over soft bottom where they are feeding on sanddabs. Copper rockfish do not feed on pyrosomes as frequently as other rockfish species.  Copper rockfish will follow prey targets, including pelagic red crabs that have been observed farther north than usual. In general rockfish catches decreased when prey (anchovies, squid, mychtophids, pyrosomes, etc.) are hyper abundant. Fishermen notice ontogenic shifts, as well as seasonal and weather related movements of copper rockfish. Copper also tend to move based on weather conditions. North of Point Conception (\PtC), copper rockfish cannot be found during bad weather and seem to move to deeper waters. This appears true of all rockfish in general with respect to long period swells that create heavy bottom surge, increased turbulence and suspend flocculent materials near the bottom. 

### Commercial Fishery

To fish copper rockfish commercially in California a Deeper Nearshore permit is needed.  The trip limits of 75 pounds per two-month period in combination with depth restrictions have negatively impacted the commercial targeting of copper rockfish. The fleet is releasing by descending back to depth more fish now with the current lower quotas. Copper rockfish are a component of the live fish fishery in both northern and southern California. They are most often targeted to be sold live, but those fish that do not survive well are sold dead at a much lower price. 
Copper rockfish are encountered at an average depth of 45 fm, but can be found out to 60 fm. 

The live fish market is constantly in flux and can be difficult to predict. In southern California, a large portion of the live-fish fishery collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned. A fisherman's market in San Diego has allowed individual fishermen to sell fish directly to the public.Many of the live fish buyers in central California transport live fish to Las Vegas, Nevada or Los Angeles and San Jose in California. 

North of Point Conception, copper rockfish is a target of the commercial fleet. North of Cape Mendocino (\CapeM), live fish sell for 3-4 times the price of dead copper. For fishermen targeting black rockfish in the north, copper rockfish are an incidental catch of value.  Out of Morro Bay, coppers ranging between 1 and 6 pounds are most common in the 10-15 fm range and also sell for $7 to $8 per pound. In shallow waters, fishermen will use traps within the live-fish fleet and vertical gear for deeper waters. In Central California (near Morro Bay) the nearshore live-fish target species live in the kelp beds and larger coppers on the outside edges of the reef. Larger coppers are typically found on isolated outcrops. It's rare for the commercial live fleet to fish deeper than 15fa, and in central California it's harder to keep fish exhibiting barotrauma alive. The price of live fish is much higher.

Commercial fishermen from multiple areas along the coast emphasized that the price differential for copper by size is not as pronounced as it is for other species landed in the live-fish fishery. North of San Francisco, the commercial fleet encounters larger copper rockfish (~ 7 pounds) in general.  Fish smaller than 2.5 - 3 pounds (approximately 14-17 inches) are desired by the live-fish buyers and the restaurant market and thus will sell for a higher price. The larger fish can be retailed to the general public.

South of Point Conception, copper rockfish are not generally a target species for the live-fish fishery and have been difficult to market. The fleet is now marketing copper rockfish in Southern California as a species similar to the popular "grouper" (bocaccio rockfish, *S. paucispinis*) and demand is increasing. The majority of commercially caught copper rockfish in Southern California are sold dead.  The price of a dead copper in San Diego is around $6 per pound. The fleet can keep copper alive from depths as deep as 60 fathoms with no issue. Coppers seem to be the hardiest of the rockfish species. 


### Recreational Fishery

In 1997 there were approximately 295 CPFVs in California and in 2022 that number was reduced to 193 active Coast Guard inspected CPFVs, vessels that can carry seven or more passengers. Of the 193 CPFVs in the state, 78 fish offshore exclusively. The number of active six-pack vessels is much less.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced loads were required on the CPFVs to maintain distancing among passengers. Customers preferred the reduced loads that resulted in a less crowded vessel and have been willing to pay the increased charter costs to maintain the reduced loads post-COVID. This is true along the entire coast of California for Coast Guard inspected vessels.

#### North of Point Conception

The majority of vessels north of Bodega Bay are six-packs. Vessels fishing out of Eureka generally fish closer to shore due to weather and fuel costs. The primary target in this area is salmon, and vessels will switch to rockfish especially if salmon are not biting or is salmon season is closed.

Larger copper rockfish can be found in 40-60 feet of water and swell is a good indicator for the presence of copper rockfish. If there is swell, the copper rockfish remain close to the bottom and are not as active, i.e., reduced chance of catching copper rockfish.  In Eureka, copper rockfish are a desirable species in the recreational fleet due to their larger average size. Copper rockfish would not be caught more than 5-10 feet off the bottom. 

In central California, small copper rockfish can be found in 100+ feet of water at the edge of the Farallon Islands. The last two to three weeks of December, fishermen out of Emeryville, California find aggregations of copper rockfish on shaled beds where they are not usually present.

Small copper rockfish have been caught off the the jetties in Humboldt, Pillar Point Harbor, and San Francisco, California. In the Half Moon Bay CFPV fleet, copper rockfish are rarely observed shallower than 35 fathoms and they tend to only bite the bottom hook. The gear regulations from unlimited hooks to two hooks per line and a one pole limit in 1999-2000 resulted in increased loss of fish to sea lions. 

#### South of Point Conception

After the depth restrictions and other closures the fleet moved to different fishing ground and the desire for copper rockfish increased retention. Over half of the habitat regularly fished by the 1/2-day vessels out of Mission Bay in San Diego is now within in protected areas closed to fishing, and the depth closures moved effort from offshore to inshore (<50-60fa) starting in 2001. During the summer months the effort of the fleet in southern California shifts to pelagic species and kelp and sand bass, the timing of which is dependent on ocean temperatures. There is more pressure on the rockfish stocks during cold water years.

The business of the recreational fleet is tied to the state of the economy. When fuel prices are high there are fewer boats fishing. Around 2014-2015, as the economy recovered, business started increasing.  Beginning in 2022, the CPFV fleet in southern California made a concerted effort to avoid copper rockfish grounds, and when copper rockfish were encountered, encouraged their clients to release and descend copper rockfish back to depth. Anglers who were not catching as many fish were more interested in retaining their copper rockfish.

In general, there is less rocky habitat in southern California compared to northern California. In southern California towards San Diego, coppers are typically found in less than 35 fathoms with juveniles in less than 10 fathoms. In some areas, size classes of coppers are mixed and are not caught deeper than 60 fathoms.

A portion of the U.S. fleet fishes rockfish in Mexican waters where there are some known areas of higher copper rockfish density. At the Coronado Islands in Mexico, coppers are typically found in 28-35 fathoms on low-relief habitat. Fishing is more consistent in Mexican waters.

The activity of private vessels is dependent on ocean conditions, the vessel's size, range and fuel costs. Private vessels of >25 feet are usually focused on pelagic species and may fish rockfish during the transit to or from HMS grounds.  It's difficult for the private anglers to access offshore waters at depths of 50+ fathoms.



### Additional Notes of Interest

Some of the meeting attendees participate in Cooperative Research, such as the NWFSC and the CCFRP Hook and Line surveys and the SWFSC Cooperative Sampling Program.

During the NWFSC Hook and Line survey, there have been times when the vermilion and widow rockfishes are abundant and the lines are reeled in before even reaching the bottom where copper rockfish may be encountered. Anglers who previously participated in ROV studies with NMFS observed rockfish species moving to the bottom and hiding in crevices when the ground swell reached 6-7 ft. There is interest in participation in future ROV surveys.  

We heard interest from the CPFV fleet in deploying conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) devices during their trips. Fishermen are interested in tagging fish they release.

The number one question posed to the STAT at all meetings was, "How will the stock assessment account for closed areas?" The fleet would like to see some accounting for these areas in the assessment models.
