            Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them. Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size (L∞), with L∞ increasing from south to north. This cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific case of the widely described Bergmann’s rule, and we explore specific potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.},

	abstract = {Rockfish are an important component of West Coast fisheries and California Current food webs, and recruitment (cohort strength) for rockfish populations has long been characterized as highly variable for most studied populations. Research efforts and fisheries surveys have long sought to provide greater insights on both the environmental drivers, and the fisheries and ecosystem consequences, of this variability. Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winterspawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014–2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events. Species association patterns of pelagic YOY for over 20 rockfish taxa in space and time are also described. The overall results will help inform future fisheries-independent surveys, and will improve future indices of recruitment strength used to inform stock assessment models and marine ecosystem status reports.},

	abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

Adults are commonly distributed in temperate coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from British Columbia to southern California, including the inland waterways of Puget Sound, Washington, a semi-enclosed fjord system of known postglacial origin. Here, we report the distribution of genetic variation at six microsatellite DNA loci from six locations throughout the species’ range. Among four coastal samples, significant population subdivision was detected (FST = 0.007), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed. Divergence was large and significant between Puget Sound proper and coastal samples (FST = 0.087). A sample taken only 100 km north of Puget Sound (the Canadian Gulf Islands) was also highly divergent from Puget Sound and coastal samples and was genetically intermediate between the two. The Puget Sound sample also displayed significantly lower allelic diversity and a more substantial presence of private alleles. The patterns of genetic divergence and diversity are most consistent with a historical colonization followed by limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations.},

Resighting of tagged rockfishes (512 tagged rockfishes and 726 resightings) from July 1986 through June 1988 indicated that home ranges, movements from reefs, and tendency to return from experimental displacement (up to 8.0 km) were significantly different on the three habitat types compared. On high relief rocky reefs, rockfishes maintained small home ranges (most within 30 m2) and displayed strong reef fidelity that was not affected by season; no off-reef movement was detected and rockfishes generally returned from displacements. On artificial reefs, rockfishes also maintained small home ranges (most within 30 m2), however, there were pronounced seasonal habitat preferences. In the summer, artificial reefs become less suitable; considerable off-reef movement occurred and rockfish did not return from displacements. In contrast, during fall and winter, rockfishes remained on artificial reefs and returned from displacements. On low relief rocky reefs, rockfishes maintained considerably larger home ranges (most within 400 m2 and some up to 1500 m2) and habitat use was strongly affected by season; rockfishes only inhabited low relief reefs in the summer and only returned from displacements in the summer coincident when peak algal cover. In addition, there was substantial movement between artificial reefs and adjacent low relief reefs; many rockfishes leave artificial reefs in the summer, move to low relief reefs, and return to artificial reefs in the fall when kelp disappears on low relief reefs. Through habitat assessment, movement in response to habitat quality, and ability to home, these rockfish maintain a flexible behavior for optimal habitat use. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of US west coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step towards developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age 1-fish. First, a conceptual life-history approach is used to generate life stage- and spatio-temporally-specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female-spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40-48 °N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (1) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (2) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (3) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (4) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspecification due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s r (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspecification, but the magnitude of Mohn’s r tends to be lower when the model is not misspecified. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s r differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn’s r is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass.

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment., An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources., The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime., In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore., More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their first year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species specific when possible.},

Models that do not account for this difference in timing will overestimate abundance for a decreasing stock and underestimate increases during a recovery period.Weinvestigated the effect of incorporating unequal recruitment and mortality time lags into depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA), a stock assessment method for data-poor species. Using both simulated data and catch series of Pacific rockfish (Sebastes spp.), we found that for declining stocks with no mortality delay and a recruitment time lag equal to age-at-maturity, estimated overfishing limits were up to 40\% lower than those from the model with both time lags equal to age-at-maturity. Deviation between the two models’ predictions increases with age-at-maturity and natural mortality rate, suggesting that time lag separation is most important for long-lived species. We propose a correction factor for net production models that eliminates stock overestimation due to implicitly equal time lags.},

Rockfish availability also decreased when turbulence, sea level, and sea-surface temperature were high during winter.

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

	abstract = {Although fishing is an important recreational activity in southern California, there is no recent description of its distribution in the watersheds. With increased focus on pollution control, there is a need for understanding the extent of fishing and fish consumption as a beneficial use in these watersheds. This study describes the general extent of fishing and fish consumption in six watersheds of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties: Ventura River, Santa Clara River, Calleguas Creek, Malibu Creek, Los Angeles River, and San Gabriel River. Of about 41 freshwater and anadromous fish species in these watersheds, 83\% are introduced species. In addition, there are about 36 species of estuarine and surf zone fishes just seaward of the mouths of these rivers and creeks. We conducted a field survey during January-December 2005 to census fishers by fishing areas (estuary/river mouth, coastal terrace streams, urban lakes, mountain reservoirs, and mountain streams) in the watersheds. Fishers were interviewed to obtain information on their fishing habits and consumption of fish in these watersheds. Teams of two interviewers conducted surveys on four week days and five weekend days per month during this period. Sites were selected from a stratified random sampling design. In all, 273 site visits were conducted at 82 of 86 targeted sites. We observed 1,243 fishers and 495 were interviewed; of these, 238 consumed fish they caught, and 140 provided sufficient information to calculate consumption rates. Most fishers and consumers occurred at urban lakes and mountain reservoirs, fewer at mountain streams and estuary/river mouths, and least at coastal terrace streams. Stocked rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were the most frequently consumed species. The overall mean, median, and upper decile consumption rates were 34.9, 16.2, and 70.6 g/day, respectively, for fish caught in the Ventura and Los Angeles County watersheds in 2005. In contrast, the Santa Monica Bay fish consumption study of recreational anglers in 1990-1991 obtained overall mean, median, and upper decile consumption rates of 50, 21, and 107 g/day for marine fish caught in the Bay. Consumption rates in the present study varied by ethnicity of fishers, species of fish consumed, watershed, and fishing area. Consumption rates and other information collected during this study may be used in Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) assessments of these watersheds to determine beneficial use and potential health risks of these watersheds.},

The aims of these exploratory fishing surveys were: (1) to describe the zoogeographic distribution patterns of the animals encountered and the relationship of such patterns to observed environmental features; (2) to determine their relative abundance in time and space and to each other and their vulnerability to sampling gears; and (3) where possible, to establish approximations of the magnitude of important or potentially important commercial species together with estimates of the physical yields that these resources might provide. A general review is given of U.S. demersal fish explorations in the northeast Pacific Ocean along with the methodology employed. Methods for estimating standing stocks based on fish densities determined from catch-per-unit-of-effort data are given. Using this procedure, estimates have been made for the more abundant demersal fish forms in the northeast Pacific. Means of determining yield possibilities are suggested, based on natural mortality rates and standing stock sizes. This method assumes that the maximum sustainable catch will range from.4 to.5 of the virgin stock size times the natural mortality. Finally the authors evaluate the reliability of exploratory fishing surveys based on subsequent development of commercial fisheries in the northeast Pacific. The data appear to have provided a good basis for describing the distribution and availability of important demersal fish elements in this area. Although estimates of yield potentials are still being studied, the history of fisheries development has, to date, followed quite well what might have been expected as a result of the preliminary yield forecasts.},

	abstract = {I evaluated a standard monitoring unit for the recruitment of reef fishes (SMURF) as a tool for ascertaining spatial and temporal patterns of reef fish recruitment in central California, USA. SMURFs consisted of a 1.0 x 0.35 m dia. cylinder of fine mesh plastic grid that contained a folded section of larger mesh plastic grid. SMURFs collected new recruits of 20 species of fish with 92\% of the individuals collected from 10 species, mostly rockfish (genus Sebastes). An experiment varying depth of SMURFs in the water column (surface, mid-depth, or bottom) showed that surface SMURFs collected the greatest diversity of species and significantly greater abundance for eight species, with two species having significantly greater abundance on mid-depth SMURFs and three species having significantly greater abundance on bottom SMURFs. A comparison of cumulated recruitment from SMURFs that varied in sampling frequency (removal of new recruits every 1-3, 7, or 28 days) suggested that increasing the time between sampling caused a significant decrease in recruitment estimates for some species but not for others. To determine how well temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs reflected patterns to nearby reefs, I compared within season temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs with that at nearby reefs, estimated by visual transect surveys conducted on scuba. Temporal patterns of recruitment to SMURFs were significantly and positively related to early recruitment on reefs for one group of benthic-algal associated rockfish species when diver surveys were lagged by 30 days (r=0.87) and for another group of canopy-algal associated rockfish species when lagged by 5 days (r=0.72). SMURFs appeared to be an effective and efficient method for indexing relative rates of delivery of competent juveniles for many temperate nearshore reef fishes.},

At broad-scales (km's), habitat strata classified from acoustic maps were a strong predictor of fish assemblage composition. At intermediate-scales (m's-100 m's), fish species were associated with specific substratum patch types. At fine-scales ({\textless}1 m), microhabitat associations revealed differing degrees of microhabitat specificity, and for some species revealed niche separation within patches.

This technique counts ionized radium atoms directly; therefore, the uncertainty of the technique is superior to conventional radio-decay dependent techniques. Calcium and barium are major components of the otolith matrix that can interfere with TIMS analysis of radium. To remove these interferants, an ion-exchange separation procedure was developed. This procedure was tested by applying it to otolith samples from three fish species in three separate radiometric ageing studies. The resultant separations and TIMS determinations indicate that the procedure efficiently separates radium from calcium and barium. Measured 226Ra activities for each species were similar to previous radiometric ageing studies, with the exception of one sample. When results were compared with traditional 226Ra determination techniques, radon emanation and α-spectrometry, the separation procedure with isotope-dilution TIMS had significant advantages. Samples over three times smaller than attempted in other studies were processed with decreased uncertainty and processing time.},

	abstract = {All offshore oil and gas platforms have finite economic life spans. One o fthe decommissioning options for these platforms is complete removal, requireing the use of explosives to dislodge the support structure from below the seafloor. Off California, this decomissioning option would kill large numbers of platform-associated and commercially important groundfishes that inhabit the bases of the platforms, and may potentially affect regional fish populations. Capturing and translocation fishes before removing a platform might mitigate the effects of platform removal. In this study, we acoustically tagged 79 rockfishes and lingcod from three oil platforms in the east Santa Barbara Channel and translocated them to a natural reef inside a state marine reserve at Anacapa Island to determine whether individuals would home back to their platforms of capture, or take up residency at their new location. Movements between natural and platform habtitats were monitored over a two-year period. Twenty-five percent of all tagged fishes translocated to a natural reef returned to their home platforms relatively quickly, traveling distances from 11 km to {\textgreater} 18km, in 10.5h to 17d. Those that did not home took up residency at Anacapa Island, moved to Santa Cruz Island, or out of the range of detection. Although a small proportion of fish (25\%) homed back to the platforms, a higher proportion (75\%) remained at their platforms of release. Those that homed back to their platform of capture did so relatively quickly (avg 15 +-31d). Lingcod had the highest probability of homing back to their platform of capture, typically doing so in {\textless} 1 day. These results suggest that fish translocation may be successful, but costly mitigation strategy for platforms that require full decommissinoing and that some specie may be more successfully translocated than others.},

Scenarios with fish movement, illegal fishing in the reserve, or post-dispersal density dependence in recruitment required higher density ratio targets, such as 60\% of mature fish or 80\% of all fish, to avoid stock depletion. The effort allowed by multispecies density-ratio control rules depended on the relative weight given to more or less depleted species. High variability in recruitment or in monitoring data caused the allowable effort to fluctuate. Density-ratio control rules have the advantages that they require no historical data, they can be used at local spatial scales, and they adjust to changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Climate change has caused shifts in seasonal timing of climatic events such as the onset of spring upwelling, which can lead to temporal mismatches between fish spawning and production of zoopklankton prey. Fishing may exacerbate mismatches through age truncation, particularly when offspring survival is dependent on maternal age, but no-take reserves or harvest reductions might buffer this effect. To quantify the potential for management to buffer synergistic interactions between fishing and climate, we developed a dynamic population model of a harvested species where larval survival depended on spring transition timing and maternal age. We applied this model to rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) after verifying empirically that spring transition timing affects their recruitment success. We found that yield and persistence changed more with maternal-agedependent larval provisioning than maternal-age-dependent spawning timing across a range of spring transition timings, especially with environmental stochasticity. Either implementing reserves or reducing fishing can mitigate impacts on larval survival, but reserves convey the added benefit of decreased sensitivity of yield and persistence to fishing. However, reserve buffering effects decreased with the inclusion of environmental stochasticity.},

For example, in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles' competitors, overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the overfished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no-take reserve. Ignoring community interactions, the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However, after incorporating community interactions, the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model, the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species, and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible. © 2006 NRC.},

Density analysis of trawl start locations demonstrated how fishing efforts increased and decreased in relation to habitat distribution and fishery management actions between 1995 and 2002. Trawl effort patterns exhibited significant interannual variability and were patchy in distribution. Tow end-point locations from 1998 to 2001 were retrieved from manual logbooks for five reference sites located in proximity to rocky habitat. Trawl towlines were mapped and demonstrated a marked enhancement of fine-scale fishing effort resolution. Spatial shifts in fishing intensity (measured as kilometres towed) away from rock habitat were evident at all reference sites after the footrope restriction, with an average reduction of 86\%. Some slight shifts into surrounding unconsolidated sediments also occurred. Our results indicate that the footrope restriction, in conjunction with associated landing limits, was effective in protecting rocky habitats from trawl fishing impacts.

Principal component analysis was used to characterize the dominant patterns in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over time (1957-1999) and space (10′ latitude x 10′ longitude blocks). Ocean climate explained 60\% of the variation in CPUE and revealed opposite responses in northern and southern California. In warm El Niño years, CPUE was 4.2 times higher in the north and 1.8 times lower in the south. CPUE responded similarly to low-frequency climate shifts by increasing in the north and decreasing in the south after 1976-1977. Four geographic regions responded as discrete units to environmental forcing and fishing intensity: North, Central, South, and Channel Islands. Over time, annual fish landings declined sharply in the South, with fishing effort remaining stationary and high relative to that in the other regions. In the North, landings and fishing effort remained tightly coupled, with effort an order of magnitude lower than in the South.

Rockfish are live-bearers with a diverse array of reproductive strategies. Understanding the reproductive potential of an exploited stock is critical to assessing the health and status of a fishery. We investigated the reproductive ecology of four rockfish species to examine species contrasts and to determine spatial and maternal-size effects on reproductive potential. Females were sampled during the winter parturition season (November through March) of 2009 through 2012. Maternal length and somatic weight were positively correlated with relative fecundity (larvae per g somatic weight) in all four species, indicating a disproportionately greater reproductive output by larger, older females. Fecundity estimates in Chilipepper, S. goodei, and Yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, varied regionally, but did not significantly differ over time within the years sampled (sample sizes for Speckled, S. ovalis, and Blackgill rockfish, S. melanostomus, were too small to allow spatiotemporal comparisons). Two reproductive strategies were evident as Yellowtail and Blackgill rockfish produced a relatively highly fecund, single brood of smaller-sized larvae annually, in contrast to Chilipepper and Speckled rockfish, which produced larger-sized larvae with lower fecundity. In some regions multiple broods were common, complicating estimates of annual fecundity for these two species. There was some evidence that egg production was positively correlated with female condition, indicating that environmental variability in oceanographic conditions and productivity may drive changes in fecundity and reproductive strategy (i.e., single versus multiple broods).},

Move-on rules are regulations or guidelines that trigger the temporary closure of a fishery in a targeted area when a bycatch threshold is reached, without the closure of the entire fishery. Move-on rules based on spatiotemporal autocorrelation (clustering) were effective in reducing bycatch with modest impact on target catch, removing between 35\% and 77\% of future hauls with bycatch within a specified distance and time of a bycatch-containing haul, while foregoing target catch by an average of 12\%. The spatial and temporal peak clustering scales show correlation with the level of schooling behavior by each species; however, the efficiency of the rules measured either in reduction in bycatch hauls or diminished target catch was not strongly affected by those aggregation behaviors.

To statistically verify pattern matching, we fit each time series of otolith measurements with a spline, and all measurements were divided by the values predicted by the curve. This standardized each time series to a mean of 1, removing the effects of age on growth and homogenizing variance. Each time series was then correlated with the average growth patterns of all other series, yielding an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.53.

At each site, synchronous growth patterns were matched among otoliths via the process of cross-dating, ensuring that the correct calendar year was assigned to all increments. Each time series of growth-increment measurements was divided by the values predicted by a best-fit negative exponential function, thereby removing age-related trends.

The two northern growth chronologies positively correlated with indices of warm ocean conditions, especially from the prior summer through the spring of the current year. During the same period, the California chronology positively correlated with indices of cool ocean conditions, indicating an opposing productivity regime for yelloweye rockfish between the California Current and the Gulf of Alaska.

All time series were exactly dated and spanned 1972 through 1994. In a principal components analysis, the leading principal component (PC1bio) accounted for 64\% of the variance in the data set. By entering the upwelling index, the Northern Oscillation index, sea surface temperatures, and the multivariate ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) index into principal components analysis, a time series of environmental variability PC1env was developed for each month of the year. Over the interval 1972 through 1994, PC1bio most strongly correlated with PC1env for February and, to a lesser extent, January and March. Moreover, when each of the six biological time series was related to the 12 PC1env through stepwise multiple regression, February was always the most significant (p {\textless} 0.01). The same was true if upwelling index was substituted for PC1env. As upper-trophic predators, rockfish and seabirds independently corroborate that wintertime ocean conditions are critical for productivity in the California Current ecosystem.},

S. pinnigerand S. diploproa were collected extensively over their wide latitudinal ranges in the northeast Pacific Ocean. In both species, females grew faster and larger than males. Growth of S. pinnigerdid not vary with latitude. For S. diploproa, however, there was a cline of increasing growth with higher latitude. In the habitat of the adult fish, which are demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope, latitudinal variation in environmental factors, such as temperature and oxygen concentration, appears insufficient to account for the observed differences in growth. Thus two other possible causes of the growth cline are discussed. First, S. diploproa has been exploited by fisheries more in the north than in the south, possibly resulting in more available prey and thus increased growth in the north (short term density-dependent response). The second possible cause is a density-independent, evolutionary response at the population level characterized by differences in reproductive strategy. Reproductive success in the southern part of the range of this species is probably less predictable due to the effects of oceanographic currents on the survival of epipelagic larvae and prejuveniles; reproductive effort in the south would therefore be greater. The relative importance of the suggested mechanisms for growth differences requires further elucidation from population genetics and studies of density effects and fishing pressure.},

In the summer upwelling season, juveniles may be captured in tidepools and shallow coastal waters, where temperatures may be as low as 8°C, or in shallow estuarine habitats where temperatures reach 18°C. This study was conducted to determine the effects of temperature, ration, and fish size upon growth. Juveniles 35 to 93 mm standard length were acclimated to 7°, 12°, and 18°C and provided four daily rations (nominally 0, 25, 50, and 100\% maximum ration); growth and food consumption were monitored over 57 days. Growth in length ranged from -0.023 to 0.314 mm per day, relative growth in weight ranged from -0.689 to 1.495\% body weight per day, and gross conversion efficiencies ranged from -13 to 21\% among treatments. Under starvation conditions, weight loss increased with increasing temperature. At rations expressed as percent maximum at a given temperature, growth increased with increasing temperature. Maximum relative ration (\% body weight per day), however, decreased with decreasing temperature; at equivalent relative rations, growth did not differ significantly among temperatures. Evacuation rates determined at the experimental temperatures suggest that daily ration is limited by digestion rate and that temperature therefore affects energy turnover. Growth was analyzed with multiple regression models with ration, temperature, and initial weight as independent variables. Relative growth increased with increasing initial weight. The model predicts that relative maintenance rations decrease with increasing size. The percentage of full ration represented by maintenance ration is relatively greater for small fish at low temperatures, suggesting a basis for ontogenetic change in thermal optima for growth. The results of this study suggest that thermal environment may have an important effect upon first year growth of juvenile S. melanops. © 1983 Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

Reyes, central California) on a monthly basis from May 1985 through April 1986 to determine their annual reproductive cycle. Since histological methods provide precise and detailed information, this method was employed to (1) examine oocytes and embryos to describe developmental stages, and (2) provide temporal assessment of the annual reproductive cycle. The description and staging scheme developed provide a basis to compare reproductive developmental patterns between cycles and populations. Oogonia (Stage I) and early perinucleolus (Stage II) oocytes were present in samples from all months. Progressive growth of oocytes from early- to late perinucleolus (Stage III) was evident in spent and recovering ovaries, indicating the end of a reproductive year and the beginning of a new reproductive cycle. Initial yolk accumulation (Stage IV) occurred in July, and final yolk accumulation (Stage V) was predominant from September through January. In February, the majority of samples displayed fertilized ova in early-celled stages of embryonic development. Gestation continued for about 30 days with parturition occurring between January and March. Mature oocytes were also collected in March, suggesting the Cordell Bank yellowtail population has a prolonged reproductive season extending into April.},

We outline a simple clustering method based on Euclidean distances between trawls that offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells or statistical areas. The resulting cluster tree of trawls is divided into individual groups of trawls (fishing opportunities) using a recommended cut point. Our method correctly classified simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. Fishing opportunities were obtained for vessels in the British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery; each vessel usually fished at a wide variety (mean 26, standard deviation 16, range 2-69) of fishing opportunities. Within each fishing opportunity, trawls generally caught similar species. In the Argentina scallop fishery, our method was able to divide exploratory from regular fishing trawls, with obvious applications for catch-per-unit-effort calculations. Our method could also be used to detect positional errors in data from these fisheries. Fishing opportunities could provide indications of how fishermen might react to marine protected areas and to the imposition of quotas on multispecies fisheries. © 2005 NRC Canada.},

At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas). In senescent fisheries, vessel buyback programs must account for the fishing power of individuals and their vessels. Subsidies should be avoided as they prolong the transition towards alternative employment. Fisheries managers need to create individual incentives that align fleet dynamics and fishermen behavior with the intended societal goals.

Otolith Sr:Ca profiles from 81 species of freshwater, diadromous, and marine fish revealed that freshwater fish had low levels of Sr:Ca and lower variability than expected relative to marine fish, diadromous fish had Sr:Ca levels and variability that were consistent with expectations, and marine fish had high maximum Sr:Ca levels, as expected, and high Sr:Ca variability, similar in magnitude to diadromous fish, which was not expected.

There was no significant effect of fish length on fish orientation or whether it reacted or remained stationary during the observation. Only 1.3\% of fish were observed escaping the sweeps. A generalized linear model was used to estimate that at a distance of 73.8. cm (±3.4 SE) 50\% of observed fish reacted to the sweep. The mean distance that stationary fish were first observed reacting to the sweep was 36.6. cm (±2.0 SE). Quantitative analysis indicates that flatfish herding occurs along trawl sweeps and the effective area swept is greater than the wing spread.

	title = {Evolutionary processes contributing to population structure in the rockfishes of the subgenus genus {\textbackslash}emph\{{Rosicola}\}: implications for fishery management, stock assessment and prioritization of future analyses of structure in the genus {\textbackslash}emph\{{Sebastes}\}.},
	abstract = {This study was undertaken to identify population structure in the three rockfish species of the subgenus Rosicola through genetic analysis of six microsatelite loci applied to individuals sampled from 13 locations across the range of each species from Vancouver, British Columbia and San Martin Island, Mexico. Sampling each species throughout their respective ranges allowed for a more comprehensive and conclusive analysis of structure to inform proper stratification of stock assessments, catch tracking and management of these stocks. In addition, modeling potential evolutionary scenarios and testing for evolutionary processes shaping the current population structure were undertaken to better understand factors contributing to population structure and speciation in the subgenus. Results of this study were compared to previous research on members of this and other subgenera within the genus Sebastes to identify concordance in the phylogeography of subgenera or consistent processes between species indicative of common mechanisms contributing to genetic variation. Patterns observed were used to infer prioritization of future testing for population structure in the genus Sebastes and research to determine whether they are predictive. No significant population structure was identified in the canary rockfish S. pinniger (Gill 1864) or the sunset rockfish S. crocotulus (Hyde et al. 2008). Three genetically distinct genetic clusters indicative of separate populations were identified in the vermilion rockfish S. miniatus (Jordan and Gilbert 1880) and population structure correlated with latitude and depth. While populations were found to overlap in their distribution to some extent, population structure was consistent with the boundary between the San Diegan and Oregonian biogeographic provinces near Point Conception, California. Additional population structure in the Southern California Bight south of Point Conception was correlated with adult depth distribution with a break around 60 m (30 fathoms (fm)). Assignment tests indicated that the young of year of each population as well as S. miniatus co-occur and reside in kelp forests before making ontogenetic migration to deeper depths with age. The deepest distributed of these clusters commonly occurs in depths of up to 100 m (50 fm), beyond which S. crocotulus was the most common species 2 (Hyde et al. 2007). This population structure related to depth poses issues for stratification of historical data used in stock assessment and allocation of catch to each population as identifying characteristics have not been identified and management is already confounded by the presence of the recently identified cryptic species S. crocotulus. Previous studies hypothesized that speciation between S. crocotulus and S. miniatus was the result of paedomorphsis in the form of concatenated migration to deeper depth isolating populations by depth arising from the greater area of nearshore habitat around the channel islands during early Pliocene glaciations when sea level falls as much as 300 ft. around 2.3 MYA (Hyde et al. 2008). Tests were conducted for repetition of such a pattern in forming population structure observed in S. miniatus. Timing of divergence in S. miniatus populations identified using assignment tests was estimated to be in the late Pleistocene only 102,429 (95\% CI: 22,884 – 248,933) thousand years ago between clusters 1 and 2 and 255,141 (95\% CI: 80,080 - 592,847) thousand years ago for their common ancestor and cluster 3. This is consistent with timing of glaciations, but results indicate northward expansion of a population, which may have occurred during an interglacial period. Our analyses indicate that mutation contributes significantly to population structure between species in the subgenus, but does not contribute to population structure in S. miniatus indicating that it is due to more recent drift or selection alone. Population structure in S. miniatus consistent with northward migration of S. miniatus with lower genetic diversity indicative of a founder effect and private alleles accumulated in the time since divergence. No signal of bottleneck was present in any of the species or populations, though a model reflecting a reduction in population size in the northern population was found to have a high likelihood and posterior probability in Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis of potential evolutionary scenarios. It is possible that reductions in population size occurred too many generations ago to be detected using methods based on relationships between number of alleles and heterozygosity, given expansion of the population since its initial isolation. The results of modeling evolutionary processes indicated potential for gene flow between the northern population and deeper southern population potentially resulting in the shallow southern population. This may be the result of shared alleles from incomplete lineage sorting rather than admixture, or admixture occurred in the distant past as little evidence hybridization was observed in tests for individuals of hybrid classes. The southern shallow population had higher genetic diversity indicating that it may be an older stable population, in potential glacial refugia to the south. These results are also consistent with the possibility that population structure in S. miniatus as the result of northward expansion during the interglacial period. Though the presence of a distinct deeper population in the southern California bight is consistent with paedomorphosis posed as the mechanism resulting in divergence between S. miniatus and S. crocotulus in Hyde et al. (2008), the processes leading to the division of adults on the basis of depth is still uncertain between the shallower and deeper southern population. We postulated that migration or shifts in abundance over time to 3 glacial refugia in the south during glaciations may be associated with shifts to deeper depths to align with lower temperatures experienced at higher latitudes during the interglacial. Adults of each population would be potentially isolated from the shallower distributed progenitor taking advantage of ample nearshore habitat in the Southern California Bight during glaciations (Jacobs et al. 2007, Hyde et al. 2008). Having shifted abundance to the south and taken on adaptations to deeper depths, the now more deeply distributed population may remain isolated from the southerly shallow populations. While concordance was imperfect, analogous structure in other Subgenera within the Sebastes including the Sebastosomas (Burford and Bernardi 2008), Pteropodus (Li et al. 2006) and Sebastomus (Rocha-Oliveras et al. 1999) that reflect population structure north and south of Point Conception as well as cryptic population structure with depth in cowcod (Hess et al. 2014), which we observed in the Rosicola. In other subgenera, differentiation is commonly accompanied by color variation and many of the sister species with similar indices of differentiation to populations identified in S. miniatus are identified as separate species due to their disparate coloration. This may in part be the result of sexual selection facilitated by internal fertilization (Gunderson and Vetter 2006). Commonalities provide guidance on prioritizing future research to focus on species with distributions bridging Point Conception and a broad range of depth distributions. In addition, species with variable coloration should be considered for analysis as the line between species may be blurry but somewhat visible to the eye, needing only be confirmed by genetic analysis that can detect differentiation that in this case was indicative of a relatively recently diverged sister species (Frable et al. 2015, Narum et al. 2004). Nearshore species that release their larvae in the “sticky water” closer to shore that is slower moving due to turbulence and shear forces slowing its movement in the prevailing currents (Gunderson and Vetter 2006; Berntson and Moran 2009). This may contribute to maintenance of populations structure due to relatively inhibited larval transport compared to congeners in deeper waters spawning during periods of stronger flow of currents along the coast. These results provide guidance on selection of species for further analysis within the subgenus to identify what might be population structure or cryptic species that should be accounted for in stock assessments and management where possible. Nearshore species with large ranges bridging Point Conception, California, spawning in the spring during maximal upwelling, with broad depth range and with a large degree of variability in coloration are most likely to harbor genetic variation of interest to management and their analysis may provide further understanding the speciation process in this diverse genus.},

The brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) occurs in nearshore habitat and is common from northern Baja California, Mexico to northern California, rare off the outer coast of Oregon and Washington and again common in the inland waters of Puget Sound, Washington. Here we examine patterns of microsatellite DNA diversity from throughout the species' range as an indirect measure of long-term trends in larval dispersal. Genetic divergence was large and highly significant over all populations (FST = 0.056, P {\textless} 0.0001), and was significantly correlated with geographic distance when considering coastal populations. The best estimates of mean coastal dispersal distance were on the order of 10 km or less per generation. Diversity was relatively low in the Puget Sound, suggesting that Puget Sound rockfish populations experienced a post-glacial founder effect followed by genetic isolation and low effective population size. Puget Sound individuals appeared to have recent mixed ancestry as a result of introgression with S. maliger and S. caurinus. Genetic isolation of Puget Sound fish provides a basis for consideration as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. We recommend that coastal brown rockfish fisheries be managed at regional rather than coast-wide scales, and that design of marine reserve networks considers the surprisingly low realized dispersal distance of some species with high dispersal potential. © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {The spatial patterns of genetic structure among juveniles of long-lived species can reveal the extent of interannual and geographic variation in realized larval dispersal as well as the processes that determine ecologically relevant patterns of population connectivity. However, few studies examine this temporal and spatial variation over large portions of a species' geographic range or between cryptic species that overlap in their range. Despite the potential for long-distance dispersal in blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus, a previous study of adults revealed two geographically distinct, cryptic species. To determine year-to-year variation in the patterns of spatial connectivity and to elucidate the potential ecological mechanisms involved in shaping new yearclasses and maintaining cryptic species, we sampled juveniles within California, USA, where both cryptic species coexist. Using microsatellite markers, we found geographic and temporal variation in the number of individuals from these distinct cryptic species within 2 new year-classes of juvenile S. mystinus. We also found differences in the geographic patterns of genetic structure of the 2 cryptic species. Whereas one species exhibited little or no spatial genetic structure across the study region, the other exhibited a complex geographic pattern of genetic structure, with little or no genetic structure among regions, but small-scale structure within a region. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial scales and patterns of realized dispersal of pelagic larvae vary geographically, interannually, and between closely related species with similar life-history strategies. Therefore, estimates of dispersal based on larval duration and patterns of adult structure need to be interpreted cautiously. © Inter-Research 2011.},

Since S. mystinus may live as long as 45 years and reach reproductive age at approximately 5 years, the adult population may contain as many as eight generations of reproductive adults. We investigated whether the juveniles of the 2000 year-class and the adult population were genetically homogeneous along the California coast. We sampled approximately 100 juveniles from three sites, two sites along the Monterey Peninsula (Carmel and Monterey) in central California and one at Fort Ross in northern California, and approximately 50 adult S. mystinus from five sites throughout the population center. The adult sampling spanned approximately 700 km from the northern Channel Islands to Fort Bragg. The juveniles showed significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies among distant locations and genetic homogeneity among adjacent locations. In contrast, the adults showed genetic homogeneity over large distances (San Miguel Island to Fort Bragg), indicating little limitation of gene flow in this region. Allele frequencies of juveniles differed from adult samples and in some cases reduced genetic diversity indicative of sweepstakes recruitment (small sample of the adult reproductive potential). The genetic structure of the 2000 year-class suggests that despite a genetically homogenous adult population, settled juveniles can be genetically heterogeneous along the California coast. The results also suggest that the adults, with several year-classes, are capable of maintaining a panmictic population despite the genetic distinctiveness of individual year-classes. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

In the Salish Sea, a number of MPAs protect several species of rockfish (Sebastes spp.), three of which are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA); however, the role of coastal river otter (Lontra canadensis) predation on rock-fish populations is poorly understood. This study describes the scarcely studied diet of river otters in the San Juan Islands, Washington, as a first step in assessing the potential effect of these preda-tors on rockfish. Using frequency of occurrence (\% FO), we described coastal river otter diet for San Juan, Orcas, and Fidalgo Islands during the summer of 2008. River otters consumed a vari-ety of both fish and invertebrate species. Fish occurred most frequently in their diet at all three islands, including gunnels (Pholidae) (present in 83.6 to 97.3\% of scats), sculpins (Cottidae) (79.5 to 97.3\%), and pricklebacks (Stichaeidae) (58.9 to 78.1\%). Rockfish were present in 2.7 to 21.9\% of river otter scat with the highest occurrence at San Juan Island (21.9\%). Scat also contained a higher occurrence of juvenile rockfish vs adult specimens. Although rockfish consumption by river otters at San Juan Island has increased since the summer of 1999, consistent with the establish-ment of MPAs, we cannot attribute the establish-ment of MPAs as the cause or address the positive or negative potential effects of river otter preda-tion on rockfish recovery. However, this infor-mation may assist future studies that use more modern techniques in assessing these effects on rockfish populations.},

In particular, the targeting of the largest and oldest individuals in a stock changes the age and size distribution of that stock. A large female produces a higher quantity of eggs than a young female because of its larger size, but recent laboratory evidence further indicates that large females also produce eggs of higher quality, a phenomenon known as maternal effects. However, most traditional management models assume that all female fish contribute equally per unit biomass to future recruitment. Here we investigate whether this assumption is valid by calculating the impact of maternal effects both before and after accounting for density-dependent effects. We find that the contribution of large individuals to reproduction is much more pronounced for unfished than for fished stocks. Fisheries reference points are largely unaffected by maternal effects. Our results indicate that the incorporation of maternal effects into impact assessments of fisheries is not expected to change advice substantially. Important exceptions are stocks whose demography is very vulnerable to fishing (and which therefore have low fishing reference points) for which maternal effects are relevant and necessary to consider. © 2014 Published by NRC Research Press.},

Since resource requirements of fish often change with ontogeny and reproductive condition, refuges may need to include a wide variety of habitats.

Habitat parameters were calculated from a 20 m resolution bathym-etry layer. Yelloweye and quillback were examined separately and combined with 19 other rockfish species in a species aggregate (total rockfish); occurrence data were fitted with generalized linear mixed effects models, and abundance data were fitted with zero-inflated mixed effects models. The relationship between rockfish abundance with presence–absence and slope, distance to rocky habitat, and fine bathymetric position index suggests that these species prefer rocky, steep habitat.

This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Recruitment variation in marine populations is clearly affected by physical processes in the ocean. We therefore examined correlations between long-term, high-frequency data on fish settlement on artificial substrates and oceanographic processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. We sought, for example, associations with processes occurring close in time and space to settlement events (suggesting processes affecting local delivery) or with those at particular spatial and temporal lags (suggesting influences on larval transport and survival or, at even greater time lags, on larval production). We used as response variables an 8-yr, biweekly record of settlement of three groups of fishes to sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. Predictor variables were day-specific physical processes resolved to "local" scales and then binned and lagged to represent "regional" and "basin" spatial scales and more distant time horizons. We used linear models to assess the amount of variability in settlement associated with variation in processes at different spatial and temporal scales, representing different processes such as food availability or physical transport. We found that settlement is linearly associated with a combination of large-scale factors at long time lags, consistent with variation in production at sources and early larval survivorship, and with small-scale factors at short time lags, consistent with processes aiding delivery of competent individuals to suitable nearshore habitat. Species groups differ in the relative strength of these factors, potentially because of different biological attributes. © 2010 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

California may permit some portion of the structures of offshore oil and gas platforms to remain in place if a "net benefit to the marine environment" can be demonstrated. Here we assess habitats at 23 oil and gas platforms in terms of site- and speciesspecific estimates of potential reproductive output. We identified 17 fish species (15 rockfishes Sebastes spp.) that have potential reproductive output densities (no. eggs m-2) on individual platforms that were tens to hundreds of times their average on natural reefs in the study area, with the highest potential reproductive output values being observed on platforms for all but two of these species. These extreme values were typically observed in platform base habitats, and likely result from the combined effects of high levels of fish recruitment to midwater platform habitats, relatively low fishing activity on these structures, and ontogenetic habitat use (depth-specific) patterns that make some platforms better habitats for some species based on the seafloor depth where they are sited. However, spatial variability was also very high across both platform and natural reef sites, including reproductive potential for almost all focal species being zero at the majority of surveyed sites. The contribution of fish reproductive potential to the discussion of decommissioning alternatives should therefore be considered on a case-by-case basis for each platform in California.},

Most previous estimates have come from estuarine environments, generally regarded as one of the most productive ecosystems globally. High rates of fish production on these platformsultimately result fromhigh levels of recruitment and the subsequent growth of primarily rockfish (genus Sebastes) larvae and pelagic juveniles to the substantial amount of complex hardscape habitat created by the platform structure distributed throughout the water column. The platforms have a high ratio of structural surface area to seafloor surface area, resulting in large amounts of habitat for juvenile and adult demersal fishes over a relatively small footprint of seafloor.

	abstract = {When oil and gas platforms become obsolete they go through a decommissioning process. This may include partial removal (from the surface to 26 m depth) or complete removal of the platform structure. While complete removal would likely eliminate most of the existing fish biomass and associated secondary production, we find that the potential impacts of partial removal would likely be limited on all but one platform off the coast of California. On average 80\% of fish biomass and 86\% of secondary fish production would be retained after partial removal, with above 90\% retention expected for both metrics on many platforms. Partial removal would likely result in the loss of fish biomass and production for species typically found residing in the shallow portions of the platform structure. However, these fishes generally represent a small proportion of the fishes associated with these platforms. More characteristic of platform fauna are the primarily deeper-dwelling rockfishes (genus Sebastes). "Shell mounds" are biogenic reefs that surround some of these platforms resulting from an accumulation of mollusk shells that have fallen from the shallow areas of the platforms mostly above the depth of partial removal. We found that shell mounds are moderately productive fish habitats, similar to or greater than natural rocky reefs in the region at comparable depths. The complexity and areal extent of these biogenic habitats, and the associated fish biomass and production, will likely be reduced after either partial or complete platform removal. Habitat augmentation by placing the partially removed platform superstructure or some other additional habitat enrichment material (e.g., rock boulders) on the seafloor adjacent to the base of partially removed platforms provides additional options to enhance fish production, potentially mitigating reductions in shell mound habitat.},

The potential annual fecundity, reproductive failure rates, and relationships of these parameters to maternal size were examined. Both species have a seasonally synchronous reproductive cycle with parturition occurring in the late spring to early summer. Northern rockfish had a mean relative fecundity of 165.1 oocytes/g for specimens captured in December and 109.6 embryos/g for specimens captured in May. Light dusky rockfish had a mean relative fecundity of 152.1 oocytes/g for specimens collected in December and 108.1 embryos/g for specimens captured in May. Reproductive failure was easiest to discern for the samples from fish collected in May, with partial and total failure primarily occurring because of lack of oocyte development or fertilization failure. Northern rockfish had a rate of total reproductive failure or skipped spawning of 16.3\%, and light dusky rockfish had a total reproductive failure rate of 15.6\%. As light dusky and northern rockfish grow larger throughout their lives, their relative fecundities increase and the likelihood of reproductive failure decreases. Fecundity values, failure rates, and maternal effects on the reproductive potential of these species can be used to inform future stock assessments.},

This RE framework also accounts for the effects of selectivity on growth curve estimation by characterizing the distribution of true ages derived from multiple age reads using either an exponential or gamma distribution. Simulation testing across four life histories is used to compare the RE approach with standard nonlinear (SNL) approaches that use the primary, average, or median ages in growth estimation. Sensitivity tests compare the effects of assumed length and ageing error, selectivity, and recruitment variability on the estimation of growth curve parameters. Results support the use of the RE method using a gamma distribution over the SNL methods because RE method estimates of VBGF growth parameters were more precise across life histories and sensitivity trials. This general approach can be applied and expanded to other growth models. Applications demonstrate that the results from RE methods may differ in biologically important ways to those obtained from SNL approaches. © 2007 NRC.},

	doi = {10.1577/c08-025.1},
	abstract = {Current fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P mat ; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P opt ; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, P mega ) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as P x ) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of P x measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB0]) and limit reference point (0.25SB0) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each P x measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (L mat ) to the optimal fishing length (L opt ). Although the values of P x may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for P x cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P obj (the sum of P mat , P opt , and P mega ), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2009.},

Managing and setting harvest limits is challenging for such co-occurring species because the management targets for the less productive species may affect the fishing opportunities for the more productive species. We used simulation modeling to explore the effects of setting multi-species management targets and harvest regulations at local area or coast-wide levels. Setting management targets over the entire coast, and identifying optimal harvest rates within each local area, consistently led to the same or higher yields than setting management targets for each area. Essentially, the global conservation goal can be achieved by protecting areas in which the less productive species is abundant and by taking most of the harvest from other areas. The increases in yield do not increase the coast-wide probabilities of either species being overfished or severely depleted, but do increase these probabilities at the local area level for the less productive species. These results are magnified with increased spatial variation in the ratio of abundance and differences in intrinsic rates of growth among the fished species.},

GOA species were assigned to categories that shared similar positions in ordination space relative to the three primary gradients. From this comparative analysis, a conceptual framework is proposed for species' early life histories representing trade-offs in adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions and associated vulnerability and resilience factors that may modulate species' recruitment responses to environmental variability. The utility of this framework for evaluating response to environmental forcing was supported by the analysis of a 27-year time series of GOA late spring larval fish abundance. The hypothesis for this ongoing research is that we can utilize similarities in reproductive and early life history characteristics among species to identify (i) ecologically determined species groups that are predisposed to respond to environmental forcing in similar ways and (ii) plausible environmental predictors of recruitment variation attributable to aspects of early life history.},

	abstract = {The islands off southern California diversify the coastal environment by doubling the length of shoreline and extending coastal habitats (Horn 1974). Geologically, and perhaps biologically, these islands may be classified into northern (bordering the Santa Barbara Channel) and southern groups (Hewatt 1946, Valentine and Lipps 1967, Weaver and Doerner 1967). Yet classification of the insular shore fish fauna is more complex. On a broad scale, distributions of shore fishes are influenced by water temperature and associated currents: the cool, southerly-flowing California Current offshore, and the warmer, inshore countercurrent and eddy (Hubbs 1967, 1974, Neushul et al. 1967). Also, the specific assemblage of fishes in a given area will depend very strongly on the habitat structure there. And finally, isolation at islands may be brought about either by differential transport of species having planktonic larvae (Kanter 1980, Seapy and Littler 1980) or by chance transport of species that have no planktonic dispersal stage (cf. Haldorson 1980). Our study analyzes the effects of habitat on the composition of one element of the inshore fish fauna, the kelp-bed Fishes, and applies this analysis to compare the kelp-bed fish assemblages at Santa Cruz Island with those from the adjacent Santa Barbara mainland. Some papers in this symposium dealt with large-scale biogeography of inshore organisms on the California Islands (Seapy and Littler 1980, Silva 1978). Even though we do not address this problem directly, we realize that interpretations of habitat effects must consider geographic affinities of the fauna. On the other hand, habitat effects may confound broad-scale geographic effects (cf. Kanter 1980, Littler 1980). Our objective, therefore, is to show how assemblages of kelp-bed fishes may be classified into particular habitat groups, and how differences in structural habitat affect the composition of fish assemblages making up such groups. We did our study off Santa Barbara, at the southern end of a transitional zone between a warm-temperate biota to the southeast and a cool-temperate biota at San Miguel Island and north of Point Conception (cf. Hewatt 1946, Hubbs 1948, 1960, 1974. Neushul et al. 1967, Quasi 1968b. Ebeling et al. 1971). The mixed composition of the fauna reflects water tempera-lure and exposure to currents. The California Current carries cool water seaward past Point Conception, although a small branch of this current feeds a counterclockwise eddy in the western part of the Santa Barbara Channel (Reid 1965, Kolpack 1971). This eddy meets warmer currents from the southeast at the eastern end of the Channel, near Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz Island (Kolpack 1971). Therefore, even though oceanographically complex, our study areas are warmer and more exposed to southern currents than is San Miguel Island at the western end of the channel. Given the geographic affinities of the fish fauna in our study areas, we investigated the influence of structural habitat on the composition of fish assemblages in and about beds of giantkelp(Macrocystis). In this way, we hoped to explain any "island effect" on these assemblages. as expressed by differences in species abundance and composition between Santa Cruz Island.. and the Santa Barbara mainland. Inshore habitats vary along several environmental gradient (Limbaugh 1955, North 1963, Quast 1968a, Frey 1971). For example, density of giant kelp varies with depth and several other factors (Neushul et al. 1967, North 1963, 1971, Quast 1968a. Pearse and Lowry 1974). A depth-related gradient in dominant plants extends from surfgrass, boa kelp, or Pterygophora-Eisenia communities inshore, through giant kelp and red algae at intermediate depths, to depauperate plant communities in deeper water (Clarke and Neushul 1967, Neushul et al. 1967). Such biotic gradients follow abiotic gradients in temperature, light, wave surge, and productivity (Quast 1968a, Pequegnat 1964). A gradient in substrate type extends from flat and soft bottoms of sand and/or mud, through flat and hard bottoms, to high-relief rocky reefs; the "turf" of sessile animals and plants that covers these reefs varies with degree of water movement, silting, scouring, light penetration, and grazing (McLean 1962, Pequegnat 1964, Turner et al. 1965, 1968, Clarke and Neushul 1967, North 1971, Pearse and Lowry 1974, Neushul et al. 1976). Much like a forest, giant kelp provides a vertical gradient along which animals tend to stratify in the water column. Kelp stipes in midwater and the dense canopy near the surface provide shelter, food, and landmarks for a variety of fishes (Hobson 1965, Quast 1968b, Feder et al. 1974, Alevizon 1976). Limbaugh (1955) and Quast (1968b, 1968c) analyzed kelp-bed fish assemblages mainly in the San Diego area of southern California. Miller and Geibel (1973) and Burge and Schultz (1973) analyzed such assemblages off central California, north of Point Conception. These investigators evaluated specific responses of individual species to their natural environment and were concerned with how assemblages may respond to changes in structural habitat. Excepting a few fragmentary observations and species lists (Hewatt 1946, Clarke and Neushul 1967, Neushul et al. 1967, Quast 1968c), however, there was almost no published information from the Santa Barbara area. We supplement these seminal studies of southern and northern regions by taking a more synthetic approach to analyzing species assemblages in the less well-known transitional region off Santa Barbara. Thus, although we must interpret our results in terms of behavior of particular species, our results provide an overall view of changing fish assemblages. Hopefully, our synecological approach reveals general trends not immediately obvious from autecological studies. We compared kelp-bed fish assemblages sampled at different localities along Santa Cruz Island with assemblages sampled at different localities along the Santa Barbara mainland. We first determined the structure of assemblages by identifying subgroups of species ("habitat groups") that tend to associate with different positions on environmental gradients in and about areas of reef and kelp. We then compared the density, diversity, and composition of assemblages among localities, between mainland and island, and between seasons. With this information, we were better able to distinguish and explain any island effect on the assemblages, in light of the faunal complexity of the region.},

Rockfishes have 2 major seasons of larval extrusion, winter (November-March) or spring (April-July). The reproductive season for a particular species will fall within one of the major seasons throughout its geographic range. Within the major season, annual variations in the peak month of larval extrusion was observed for individual species. A long reproductive season and variations in the annual timing of that season are evidence of plasticity in reproductive biology. -from Author},

	abstract = {Ocean systems, and the culturally and commercially important fishes that inhabit them, face growing threats. Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last 60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89\% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21\%) and 1990s (17\%). Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region. This study illustrates a repeatable method for using traditional and local knowledge to extend baselines for data-poor species, and highlights the value of integrating Indigenous knowledge into fisheries research and management.},

	abstract = {To investigate the possibility that oil and gas platforms may reduce recruitment of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) to natural habitat, we simulated drift pathways (termed "trajectories" in our model) from an existing oil platform to nearshore habitat using current measurements from high-frequency (HF) radars. The trajectories originated at Platform Irene, located west of Point Conception, California, during two recruiting seasons for bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis): May through August, 1999 and 2002. Given that pelagic juvenile bocaccio dwell near the surface, the trajectories estimate transport to habitat. We assumed that appropriate shallow water juvenile habitat exists inshore of the 50-m isobath. Results from 1999 indicated that 10\% of the trajectories represent transport to habitat, whereas 76\% represent transport across the offshore boundary. For 2002, 24\% represent transport to habitat, and 69\% represent transport across the offshore boundary. Remaining trajectories (14\% and 7\% for 1999 and 2002, respectively) exited the coverage area either northward or southward along isobaths. Deployments of actual drifters (with 1-m drogues) from a previous multiyear study provided measurements originating near Platform Irene from May through August. All but a few of the drifters moved offshore, as was also shown with the HF radar-derived trajectories. These results indicate that most juvenile bocaccio settling on the platform would otherwise have been transported offshore and perished in the absence of a platform. However, these results do not account for the swimming behavior of juvenile bocaccio, about which little is known.},

	abstract = {Interim assessments were prepared for Area 3C and 3D petrale sole, Area 5C-E Dover sole, Area 5A, 5B and 5C-D rock sole and Area 5C-D English sole. A detailed assessment was prepared for Area 3C-D Dover sole. Data analyzed for the interim assessments include: 1) catch-effort data from the commercial fishery and 2) length composition data from the commercial fishery. Information used for the detailed assessment for Area 3C-D Dover sole included 1) catch-effort data from the commercial fishery and 2) biological and catch-rate data from two biomass surveys. Petrale sole stocks remain at a very low level. Recruitment for the 'southern' stock shows no sign of an increase in more than a decade. Recruitment for the 'northern' stock appears to be increasing based on length frequency anomalies but corroboration of this observation is necessary with additional year's data. The fishery for this species continues to be limited to incidental landings only. The fishery for Area 3C-D Dover sole continued to expand in 1995. CPUE indicators for the commercial fishery all indicate a decline since 1988. Both the number of vessels participating in the fishery and fishing effort have increased dramatically in recent years while CPUE has decreased. Accordingly, estimates of yield for 1997 have been revised downward from 1996. Area 5C-E Dover sole continued to be exploited above the high-risk level in 1995. Commercial CPUE has been in decline since 1993. Stock abundance as indicated by CPUE from the commercial fishery appears to be declining over the last three years although CPUE in 1995 is close to the long-term average. Rock sole landings declined for all areas of the coast and the contribution to the fishery of the strong year-classes in the late 1980s appears to be diminishing. The stock in Area 5A appears to be near the long term average abundance for the 1954 to 1995 period as indicated by CPUE from the commercial fishery. The stock in Area 5B is below the long-term average abundance as indicated by CPUE from the commercial fishery. Yield for Hecate Strait rock sole is based on the 1995 biomass estimate from catch-age analysis. The biomass estimate for 1995 was higher than that for 1994 and the yield options for 1997 have been raised from those for 1996. Yield for Hecate Strait English sole is based on the 1995 biomass estimate from catch-age analysis. The biomass estimate for 1995 was slightly higher than that for 1994 and the yield options for 1997 have been raised from those for 1996. However, the current estimate of fishing mortality for this stock is high and further analysis will be necessary to resolve this.},

	abstract = {Marine biodiversity of the United States (U.S.) is extensively documented, but data assembled by the United States National Committee for the Census of Marine Life demonstrate that even the most complete taxonomic inventories are based on records scattered in space and time. The best-known taxa are those of commercial importance. Body size is directly correlated with knowledge of a species, and knowledge also diminishes with distance from shore and depth. Measures of biodiversity other than species diversity, such as ecosystem and genetic diversity, are poorly documented. Threats to marine biodiversity in the U.S. are the same as those for most of the world: overexploitation of living resources; reduced water quality; coastal development; shipping; invasive species; rising temperature and concentrations of carbon dioxide in the surface ocean, and other changes that may be consequences of global change, including shifting currents; increased number and size of hypoxic or anoxic areas; and increased number and duration of harmful algal blooms. More information must be obtained through field and laboratory research and monitoring that involve innovative sampling techniques (such as genetics and acoustics), but data that already exist must be made accessible. And all data must have a temporal component so trends can be identified. As data are compiled, techniques must be developed to make certain that scales are compatible, to combine and reconcile data collected for various purposes with disparate gear, and to automate taxonomic changes. Information on biotic and abiotic elements of the environment must be interactively linked.

	abstract = {Bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis) has been one of the most important species of rockfish to both commercial and recreational fisheries in California Current waters over the last century. Actions taken to rebuild the stock of bocaccio residing off of California have been responsible for dramatic changes on both commercial and recreational groundfish management and total allowable yields of most groundfish species in California waters over the last decade, including a virtual cessation of commercial and recreational fishing in 2003. In retrospect, it was determined that a strong 1999 year class was moving through the fishery at that time, resulting in high catch rates during a period in which management sought to drastically reduce catch. This results in a paradox, in which rebuilding requires strong year classes, which requires further constraints on fishing during periods in which the condition of the stock seems to be improving. Although this paradox exists for all stocks undergoing rebuilding, it is particularly pronounced for bocaccio as they have among the greatest variability in recruitment observed in any species of West Coast rockfish, as well as very rapid growth and very young age at recruitment to the recreational fishery. Consequently, accurate indices of the strength of incoming year classes both improve stock assessment estimates of future (near term) abundance trends, as well as aid regulators in making management decisions during those infrequent periods of high abundance of young fish. We discuss several indices of recruitment strength based on data on young bocaccio, evaluate their relative performance in the early detection of strong year classes, and consider both the oceanographic factors that may drive recruitment variability, as well as the spatial patterns of recruitment events which may aid in interpreting these indices.},

	abstract = {Reproductive strategies balancing offspring size and offspring number have been well documented in empirical tests of life-history theory. Here we found an additional trade-off between offspring size and offspring condition. Among 5 species of live-bearing rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) from central Californian populations, we observed a negative relationship between larval length at parturition and the size of their oil globule (a triacylglycerol-rich energy reserve). When compared with a variety of performance variables (resistance to starvation, growth, startle-escape performance and routine activity levels), it appears that this trade-off leads to a conflict when trying to optimize survival potential, with differing benefits to each trait. A large oil globule greatly increases resistance to starvation, whereas larger body size is associated with numerous performance benefits likely to synergistically decrease predation-based mortality and increase success at capturing prey (increased startle speeds and distances, as well as more rapid onset of growth and larger size at age). The trade-off between energy reserves and body size is further reflected in the seasonal patterns of parturition of the 5 species, with larvae having large oil globules and small body size being released in winter, when productivity in the California Current is low but transport is generally onshore, and those with small oil globule reserves and large body size released in late spring, when productivity is high but transport is generally offshore. These 2 apparent reproductive strategies also reflect subgeneric phylogenetic relationships, suggesting a potential lineage-specific basis for the contrast in larval traits. The results highlight the importance of measuring both physical and performance traits of larvae, as well as considering multiple attributes of both, when evaluating progeny quality. © Inter-Research 2007.},

We estimate Canadians' welfare for recovery of a representative Pacific rockfish species using referendum-style stated preference methods administered to a sample of the Canadian public via an internet panel. Hypothetical recovery programs were presented as options to a baseline of current management measures. The programs resulted in varying long term outcomes distinguished by species' future population projections. An increase in household taxes for a fixed 10 year period was employed as the proposed payment mechanism. The econometric analysis found positive and significant welfare measures for all management programs, as well as sensitivity to scope. Willingness to pay ranged from \$48 to \$180 per year per household depending on the recovery program valued. Welfare measures were found to differ significantly between those who believed their responses to be consequential and those who did not. The former provided measures that were significantly higher than the latter. We conclude with a discussion of the findings in relation to recent literature on consequentiality and incentive compatibility of stated preference questions.},

Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior pre-dictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40\% is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.},

We describe this fishery before integration, after integration, and after the yelloweye rockfish quota reduction using spatial clustering methods to define discrete fishing opportunities.

The spatial footprint (area fished) increased before integration, then decreased after integration. Each period showed shifts in utilization among four large fishing areas. Immediately after the reductions in yelloweye rockfish quota, fishing opportunities with high encounter rates of yelloweye rockfish had significantly lower utilization than areas with low encounter rates, implying rapid avoidance behaviour.},

For 80\% of analyzed species, the 75th percentile movement distance was less than 1.5 km. Movement distances of examined species are characterized by positively skewed frequency distributions and discrete movement ranges rather than unbounded diffusive or directional movement. There is no relationship between species body size and movement distance, but shallower living species move much shorter distances than deeper dwelling reef fishes. Such limited movement suggests that ecological neighborhoods of adult individuals are small, and finite movement ranges will have important consequences for understanding and modeling population connectivity in ecological and management contexts. Future research should focus on effects of habitat heterogeneity and population parameters on movement to investigate variability in movement patterns and its consequences for species' ecology and management.},

For heavily depleted species, shifts in parameters such as age and size at maturity may occur over a relatively short time period in response to changes in selective pressure or population density. We examined the reproductive biology of darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri), a commercially and ecologically important groundfish in the California Current ecosystem along the west coast of North America. The National Marine Fisheries Service currently lists darkblotched rockfish as “rebuilding” after years of intense overfishing in the 1980s and 1990s. We examined ovaries and age structures collected in 2011 and 2012 for oocyte development stage and maturity. Length and age at 50 \% maturity were estimated as 30.0 cm fork length and 6.0 years, respectively, indicating a 12 and 29 \% decrease compared to the length and age at 50 \% maturity previously reported for this stock based on specimens collected from 1986 to 1987. This reduction increased the estimate of spawning stock biomass in a recent darkblotched rockfish stock assessment. Our study also revealed spatial patterns in darkblotched rockfish maturity along the U.S. west coast, including a notable decrease in the proportion of mature fish encountered south of central Oregon. Our findings demonstrate the importance of periodically updating life history data used in stock assessment models, and also highlight the potential value of spatial management toward sustainable fishing of rockfish species.},

We tested for unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness) of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions, topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker, positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range) was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas should include the most topographically complex substrates. Our results can also help refine and test species distribution models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys are lacking.

	abstract = {Indigenous people harvest wild species for food and cultural practice, fundamentally linking biodiversity conservation and indigenous rights. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are culturally significant to indigenous people (or First Nations) of coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada, who regulate their harvest under traditional governance structures. First Nations elders, however, have observed a decline in the body sizes and abundance of rockfishes, which coincides with increased exploitation by non-indigenous fishers. Rockfishes are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity and offspring quality increase with maternal size or age, yet fisheries truncate size and age structure. During 2006, 2007 and 2013–2015, we worked with the Wuikinuxv, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai'Xais First Nations of BC's Central Coast, examining rockfish population characteristics at 282 of their fishing sites. We used hook-and-line gear to collect fishery independent data, and sampled landings from First Nations subsistence fishers. Spatial fishery closures served as experimental treatments. We also applied central place foraging theory to predict declines in size, age and abundance with increasing distance from recreational fishing lodges and other ports. Analyses used linear mixed models and controlled for environmental variables. Our results suggest that spatial closures for commercial and recreational fishers led to greater size and abundance of some, but not all rockfishes, possibly due to interspecific differences in the extent to which closures contain suitable habitat, effects of non-compliance, or other factors. Notably, Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), a species key to indigenous diets, were 21\% larger inside than outside spatial closures. Possibly reflecting cumulative fishery exploitation, however, old-aged Yelloweye Rockfish were rare. Fishery impacts on size and relative abundance decreased at sites that required longer travel times and greater fuel costs for recreational fishers to exploit, but only for the longest-lived species (size responses) and for long-lived species analysed in aggregate (abundance responses). Measures for protecting indigenous access to rockfishes include evaluation of habitat suitability and compliance within spatial closures, improved understanding of recreational fishery impacts, and treating old-age and large size structures as explicit management objectives. Our study contributes to a global effort to integrate indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

During this period, predation risk will be modulated by availability of suitable prey at the time and location of out-migration.

In this study, we quantified distributions of salmon forage assemblages relative to biogeographic breaks and ocean conditions along the California Current shelf ecosystem from Monterey Bay, California (36.5° N), to Willapa Bay, Washington (46.5° N). Epipelagic micronekton samples were collected during late springs of 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. We characterized (1) abundance of salmon forage taxa north and south of geographic boundaries, (2) spatial gradients in forage assemblages, and (3) relationships between environment and spatiotemporal variability of forage assemblages. We found higher abundances of market squid Doryteuthis opalescens, rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), and sanddabs (Citharichthys spp.) south of Cape Mendocino, while pandalid shrimp (Pandalus spp.), rex sole Glyptocephalus zachirus, and smelt (Osmeridae) were more abundant in the north. Multivariate analyses demonstrated a latitudinal gradient in the relative contribution (rank order) of individual taxa to salmon forage assemblages, and further analyses revealed the presence of 4 distinct multi-species assemblages associated with regional and meso-scale oceanographic dynamics. Our findings indicate that distributions of salmon forage assemblages and the oceanographic characteristics associated with those assemblages is similar to the spatial coherence of Chinook salmon population survival observed over longer time series.},

For each, we present the species' position within the food web, evaluate fishing mortality relative to predation mortality, and evaluate diet compositions. We find that high trophic level (TL) species, whether commercially valuable (halibut) or incidentally caught (skates), have mortality patterns consistent with single-species assessment assumptions, where fishing mortality dominates natural mortality. However, assessments for commercially valuable (pollock) or incidentally caught (squids) mid-TL species can be enhanced by including food web derived predation information because fishing mortality is small compared with high and variable predation mortality. Finally, we outline food web relationships that suggest how production of species may change with diet composition or prey availability.},

We constructed two food web network models using detailed quantitative information on the stomach contents of 57 predator (fish) species collected during trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska between 1981 and 2002. The resulting food webs displayed both small-world and scale-free network properties, suggesting that impacts on one species might spread to many through short interaction chains and that while most food web connections are not critical, a small set of fished species support critical structural connections.

For each fishing treatment, we counted and compared resulting ecosystems with no extinctions. Surprisingly, the model GOA ecosystems were robust to a wide range of functional response parameters. However, we found an abrupt threshold effect between moderate and heavy exploitation rates, beyond which a much lower proportion of model ecosystems persisted. Beyond this fishing threshold, extinction was more likely, and system attributes differed greatly from moderately fished model ecosystems. Fishing thresholds were not found with default functional response parameters, implying that model simulations should include a wide range of parameterizations to reflect ecological uncertainty and to support sustainable ecosystem-based fishery management.},

However, ephemeral, fine-scale, temporal and spatial genetic heterogeneity is frequently observed in settled propagules of marine species that otherwise exhibit broad-scale genetic homogeneity. A large variance in reproductive success is one explanation for this phenomenon. Here, genetic analyses of 16 microsatellite loci are used to examine temporal patterns of variation in young-of-year kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) recruiting to nearshore habitat in Monterey Bay, California, USA. Population structure of adults from central California is also evaluated to determine if spatial structure exists and might potentially contribute to recruitment patterns. Genetic homogeneity was found among 414 young-of-year sampled throughout the entire 1998 recruitment season. No substantial adult population structure was found among seven populations spanning 800 km of coastline that includes the Point Conception marine biogeographic boundary. Comparison of young-of-year and adult samples revealed no genetic differentiation and no measurable reduction in genetic variation of offspring, indicating little variance in reproductive success and no reduction in effective population size for this year class. Simulation analyses determined that the data set was sufficiently powerful to detect both slight population structure among adults and a small reduction in effective number of breeders contributing to this year class. The findings of high gene flow and low genetic drift have important implications for fisheries management and conservation efforts. © 2006 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Using quadrat sampling of video transects obtained by the submersible Delta, we characterized the larger invertebrates living on the shell mounds surrounding 15 oil and gas platforms (in waters 49-365 m deep) off southern California. The sea stars Patiria miniata (Brandt, 1835), Pisaster spp., and Stylasteriasforreri (de Loriol, 1887); sea anemones (Metridium spp.); pleurobranch sea slug (Pleurobranchaea californica MacFarland, 1966); and rock crabs (Cancer spp.) dominated the assemblage. In addition, spot prawns, Pandalus platyceros Brandt, 1851, and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus fragilis Jackson, 1912, were abundant at a few shell mounds, and large masses of the non-native foliose bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata (d'Orbigny, 1852), were observed at one platform. Brittle stars were also abundant in patches on some shell mounds. Over all, echinoderms were the most abundant taxa, with eight taxa of sea stars comprising 77\% of the total number of organisms counted individually. Excluding brittle stars, the sea star P. miniata attained the highest densities, up to 10 ind per m2. Except for the brittle stars and Metridium spp., which are suspension feeders, the dominant taxa were all carnivorous or omnivorous predators or scavengers, dependent primarily on the food subsidy of mussels and other fouling organisms growing on the upper reaches of each platform. Tall Metridium spp. were the only large, structure-forming invertebrates prevalent on the shell mounds. © 2010 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

Genotypes from six and seven microsatellite loci from 1206 specimens collected offshore from Washington to California were employed in the analyses. Sample sizes varied greatly among locations (n = 11-114). When adjacent samples of n {\textless} 25 were pooled using an absolute genetic distance (FST ≤ 0), the correlation between genetic and geographic distance found in the original data set increased nearly twofold, and overall FST (95\% confidence interval) increased from 0.001 (0.000-0.002) to 0.002 (0.001-0.003). Removing samples where n {\textless} 25 gave a similar result, yet the correlation increase was smaller. Another pooling strategy based on similarity tests allowed larger sizes in composite samples (n {\textgreater} 100) and further increased the correlation, although this strategy did not raise overall FST. These results indicate that under genetic isolation by distance, excessive pooling might not enhance the overall genetic differentiation among populations. The regression slope in isolation by distance plots was robust throughout all treatments, and its value suggests limited dispersal distance on this species. © 2005 NRC.},

Following calculations of age-specific survival and reproductive success from fishery data, we genotyped a sample (n = 1087) comprised by 6 cohorts (from 1995 to 2000) across 7 microsatellite loci. Our Ne estimate (N̂e) plus 95\% confidence interval was N̂e = 9157 [6495-12 215], showing that the breeding population number could be 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the census population size (N̂ = 24 376 210). Our estimates resemble closely those found for fishes with similar life history, suggesting that the small N̂e/N̂ ratio for S. crameri is most likely explained by a combination of high variance in reproductive success among individuals, genetic structure, and demographic perturbations such as historical fishing. Because small N̂e/N̂ ratios have been commonly associated with potential loss of genetic variation, our estimates need careful consideration in rockfish management and conservation. © The American Genetic Association. 2006.

The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries: inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total-harvest limits and input controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen natural experiments in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community and individual harvest or territorial rights and price ecosystem services and that are coupled with public research, monitoring, and effective oversight promote sustainable fisheries. © 2006 NRC.},

Acoustic monitoring studies indicate that olive rockfish are highly residential and that black rockfish are capable of long migrations and have less site fidelity; yet little is known about the long-term movements of blue rockfish. External tag-recapture studies indicate that blue rockfish may have intermediate movements relative to these congener nearshore species. To better understand the site fidelity, and daily and seasonal movements of blue rockfish over long ({\textgreater}1-year) time scales, we placed acoustic transmitters into 21 adult blue rockfish (30-41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California. Blue rockfish displayed intermediate movement patterns and residency relative to other similar kelp forest rockfish species. Two-thirds of tagged blue rockfish (13 fish) exhibited high residency to the study area ({\textgreater}12 mo). When in residence, mean home range of blue rockfish was 0.23 km2, however as many as 30\% of tagged blue rockfish shifted their core home range area during the study. Most shifts in home range occurred during upwelling season, and tagged fish moved up to 3.1 km when in residence. Blue rockfish with short residence times were last detected in the study area in late winter and early spring. Blue rockfish were observed at shallower depths during day than night, likely indicative of diurnal feeding. However, over longer time scales, blue rockfish were detected at deeper depths during upwelling periods and with increased wave heights. Daily and seasonal vertical movements of blue rockfish may be influenced by upwelling conditions and local prey abundance. © 2014 Green et al.},

To better understand their movements, we implanted acoustic transmitters into 23 black rockfish (29 to 41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California, USA. Tagged fish were monitored over a 16 mo period between August 2006 and January 2008. Their vertical movements were correlated with environmental variables such as atmospheric pressure, wind speed, upwelling, and wave height. From October to May, black rockfish moved to deeper waters offshore during the day and returned at night. In the summer, diurnal movements of black rockfish decreased in frequency, perhaps due to locally abundant food resources associated with seasonal upwelling. About two-thirds of the tagged black rockfish (14 fish) displayed a high degree of residency to the study area ({\textgreater}11 mo). The remaining third (9 fish) left the study area within 6 mo of release; signals from 4 of these fish were later detected on other acoustic receiver arrays {\textgreater}50 km north of Carmel Bay. Storms may have caused those fish to move northward in winter. When in residence, the mean home range of tagged fish was 0.25 km2.

Females from this segment of the population were particularly available when the cruise coincided with the period of peak spawning, and both sexes were available during the 1972 summer cruise.Within cruises, adults from different portions of the bathymetric range showed similar age composition, but there was an inverse relationship between depth and size attained by age 15. Size compositions consequently contained a smaller proportion of large fish as depth increased.Juveniles were confined to the shallow portions of the bathymetric range. There were obvious between-year changes in the length and age composition of juveniles, caused by the temporal progression of a dominant 1961 year-class.Fluctuations in availability make it difficult to monitor changes in mortality and since age composition also varies with availability, the problem is compounded further. Unless all segments of the population are located and sampled in proportion to their abundance, estimates of mortality can be made only between those cruises where the old, slow-growing component of the population is equally available.},

There was no evidence of a change in fishing effort in 83\% of the RCAs, and effort in five RCAs increased after establishment. Fishing effort in open areas adjacent to the RCAs declined with time and was higher than effort in the RCAs in all 3 years. Next, we used compliance data for 105 RCAs around Vancouver Island to model the drivers of compliance. Compliance was related to the level of fishing effort around the RCA, the size and perimeter-to-area ratio of RCAs, proximity to fishing lodges, and the level of enforcement. Noncompliance in RCAs may be hampering their effectiveness and impeding rockfish recovery.

We surveyed the fish communities of 35 RCAs and adjacent unprotected areas in southern British Columbia using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) between 2009 and 2011. We investigated the effect of protection and habitat on fish densities for six species or species groups (Quillback, Yelloweye, Greenstriped Rockfish, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod and all Inshore Rockfish combined) on transects inside and outside of RCAs. Habitat features such as percent rocky substrates and depth influenced fish density while reserve status did not. Next, we calculated habitat-based average densities and used the mean log response ratio (RR) of the density inside to outside of RCAs to determine if the amount of fishing outside the RCA, previous fishing history, the age, area or perimeter to area ratio influenced population recovery. Few positive reserve effects were apparent for any species/group. No clear patterns of RR with age were found for the RCAs, which ranged from 3 to 7 years old at the time of sampling (mean = 4.6). In addition, the intensity of fishing, size, and perimeter-to-area ratio failed to explain RR for most species. There were also no differences in size structure (length) of fish between RCAs and unprotected areas. The results give little indication that demersal fish populations have recovered inside the RCA system. Ongoing monitoring is essential to assess population recovery over time and evaluate the RCAs in terms of criteria such as habitat quality, habitat isolation and the level of compliance in order to enhance their effectiveness.},

Food overlap values (PSI) indicate that S. mystinus has low competitive overlap with all other species, and hence can coexist with two species using the same habitat. Dietary arrays reflect the distinct spatial zones occupied by most of the rockfishes. Structural characteristics associated with feeding (maxillary, intestine, and gill raker length) suggest that these species are differentially adapted in regard to feeding morphology. The coexistence of these rockfishes appears to be the result of the partitioning of food and space resources, rather than the result of stochastic events which appear to be important in the structuring of some coral-reef fish communities. S. mystinus juveniles represent a major trophic link between adult piscivores and the planktonic organisms upon which the juveniles feed.

Sablefish recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sablefish feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sablefish productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sablefish recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sablefish recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sablefish stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to fishery closures.},

Simulation testing is used to determine the statistical power of stock assessments to identify long-term, decadal-scale environmental forcing of recruitment and the ability to estimate management reference points when the duration of the fisheries time series is equal to or less than the period of the environmental cycle. Commonly used assessment methods generally lead to lower total type I (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no environmental impact) and type II (failing to detect an environmental impact when such a relationship exists) error rates. The promise of integrating environmental data with decadal-scale variability directly into stock assessments via the stock-recruitment relationship is outweighed by the pitfall of high type I error rates that are due to fishing-induced stock declines that coincide with directional environmental change. However, the impact of type I errors can be minimized by choosing an appropriate combination of assessment method and reference point estimators.},

Our primary interest was evaluating potential residence times for rockfish species in small, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) like those recently designated for Oregon waters (337–1,502 ha). We tagged 6 black rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9 yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S. maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single specimens of china rockfish S. nebulosus, vermilion rockfish S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to 27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger rockfish was small, ranging from only 2–3 m for the single tiger rockfish to 3–13 m for four of the quillback rockfish. Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in vertical movements (10–35 m and 2–33 m, respectively) within a month. Our results suggest that small, no-take MPAs located on high-relief rocky reefs would provide minimal protection for canary rockfish, some protection for black and copper rockfish, and greater protection for quillback, vermilion, tiger, and some yelloweye rockfish. © American Fisheries Society 2011.},

With the exception of three blue rockfish S. mystinus, the condition of surviving fish after cage confinement from 41 to 71 h was excellent. At capture depths up to 54 m, survival was 100\% for yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus (n = 25) and copper rockfish S. caurinus (n = 10) and 78\% for blue rockfish (n = 36).

Black rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth (m) and the surface-bottom temperature differential (°C). Blue rockfish survival was negatively associated with capture depth. Barotrauma signs and surface behavior scores were not good indicators of survival potential across species but were useful within species. In black and blue rockfish, severe barotrauma was negatively associated with survival, while higher scores on reflex behaviors at the surface were positively associated with survival.

	abstract = {Biomass estimates of several species of Alaskan rockfishes exhibit large interannual variations. Because rockf ishes are long lived and relatively slow growing, large, short-term shifts in population abundance are not likely. We attribute the variations in biomass estimates to the high variability in the spatial distribution of rockf ishes that is not well accounted for by the survey design currently used. We evaluated the performance of an experimental survey design, the Trawl and Acoustic Presence/Absence Survey (TAPAS), to reduce the variability in estimated biomass for Pacif ic ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). Analysis of archived acoustic backscatter data produced an acoustic threshold for delineating potential areas of high ("patch") and low ("background") catch per unit of effort (CPUE) in real time. In 2009, we conducted a 12-day TAPAS near Yakutat, Alaska. We completed 59 trawls at 19 patch stations and 40 background stations. The design performed well logistically, and Pacific ocean perch (POP) accounted for 55\% of the 31 metric tons (t) of the catch from this survey. The resulting estimates of rockfish biomass were slightly less precise than estimates from simple random sampling. This difference in precision was due to the weak relationship of CPUE to mean volume backscattering and the relatively low variability of POP CPUE encountered. When the data were re-analyzed with a higher acoustic threshold than the one used in the field study, performance was slightly better with this revised design than with the original field design. The TAPAS design could be made more effective by establishing a stronger link between acoustic backscatter and CPUE and by deriving an acoustic threshold that allows better identification of backscatter as that from the target species.},

These species are managed as a single mixed stock despite the fact that the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council rates them as Tier 3 species, meaning that an individual assessment including historical data is required for each. In this study, we developed a technique that distinguishes these species on the basis of otolith morphology and age, allowing both old and new collections to be identified to the correct species. Tissue samples and otoliths were collected from 1847 specimens during survey seasons in 2009 and 2013. Tissue samples were identified genetically to species by using the Sma6 microsatellite locus. We used morphometrics, weight, and age from 859 otoliths to develop a logistic regression model that identified 97.3\% of blackspotted rockfish and 86.2\% of rougheye rockfish. Otolith shape analysis distinguishes rougheye rockfish and blackspotted rockfish and can allow for more focused management of these species.},

Yelloweye rockfish responded most strongly for W1, which increased 496\% as temperature increased from 5 °C to 11 °C.

Results were compared to known values. Misspecification of M had a negligible effect on the estimation of relative stock depletion; however, misspecification of M had a large effect on the estimation of parameters describing the stock recruitment relationship, age-specific selectivity, and catchability. If high M occurs in juvenile and old fish, but is misspeci-fied in the assessment model, virgin biomass and catchability are often poorly estimated. In addition, stock recruitment relationships are often very difficult to estimate, and steepness values are commonly estimated at the upper bound (1.0) and over-fishing limits tend to be biased low. Natural mortality can be estimated in assessment models if M is constant across ages or if selectivity is asymptotic. However if M is higher in old fish and selectivity is dome-shaped, M and the selectivity cannot both be adequately estimated because of strong interactions between M and selectivity.},

This new approach aids fisheries managers who seek to understand marine species’ responses to changing oceans. In an effort to assess shifts in maturity and spawning behavior of west coast groundfish, we used this new method to evaluate spatio-temporal trends in length at maturity, the annual reproductive cycle, and spawning behavior of aurora rockfish (Sebastes aurora). We estimated biological (presence of physiological maturity markers) and functional (potential spawners in a given year) maturity using a standard logistic and the new flexible spline model. The range in lengths at 50\% maturity (biological and functional) slightly varied between the two methods (23.66–23.93 and 25.34–25.57 cm). We also investigated spatial trends in maturity and found 2 cm difference in functional maturity between fish sampled north and south of Cape Mendocino, CA (26.22–26.48 and 24.38–24.74 cm). We demonstrate model sensitivity by updating the maturity estimates in the 2013 aurora rockfish stock assessment. Absolute, but not relative, spawning output, was sensitive to model choice, spatial resolution, and the updated data. This new flexible spline model can account for skip spawning, capturing potential spawners in a given year, and thus provides accurate measurements for spawning output models.},

A Bernoulli distribution is used to model the probability of a non-zero haul and the gamma distribution to model the non-zero catch rates of four groundfish species. The use of vessel as a random effect allows the data for the various vessels to be combined and a single continuous time-series of biomass indices to be developed for stock assessment purposes. The GLMMs fit the data reasonably well. Among the different models examined, the GLMM incorporating a random vessel × year effect had the smallest ΔAIC and was thus chosen as the best model. Also, estimated random effects coefficients associated with the industry-based vessels and the FRV Miller Freeman for each year suggests that these vessels can be assumed to be from a common random effects distribution. These results suggest that combining data from the chartered industry-based vessels and from the research trawler may be appropriate to develop indices of abundance for stock assessment purposes. Finally, an evaluation of variances associated with abundance indices from the different models indicate that analyzing these data as a fixed effect GLM may underestimate the level of variability due to ignoring the grouped nature of tows within vessels. As such, use of a mixed model approach with vessel as a random effect is a reasonable approach to developing abundance indices and their variances. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis of growth for 46 species of the genus Sebastes in the eastern Pacific Ocean using a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate parameters, to investigate growth variability, and to elucidate meaningful biological covariates. Growth in terms of maximum attainable size (L ∞) ranged from 12 to 80 cm, and instantaneous growth rates varied by over an order of magnitude (K; 0.03-0.34·year-1). Results from this method also confirm the theoretical, but often untested, view that growth parameters L∞ and K are negatively correlated among populations or species of fish; Bayesian credibility intervals for correlation ranged from -0.2 to -0.7, with the posterior median of -0.4. The Bayesian hierarchical growth model showed less variability in growth parameters and lower correlations among parameters than those from standard techniques used in population ecology, suggesting that the absolute value of the correlation between L∞ and K may be lower than the general perception in the ecological literature. Exploration of several covariates revealed that asymptotic size varied positively as a function of the size at 50\% maturity. Finally, posterior probability distributions of the hyperparameters from this analysis provide plausible informative priors of growth for stock assessments of data-poor species. © 2007 NRC.},

Factors that could produce structure in cowcod include a major biogeographic boundary within cowcod's geographical distribution; severe declines in abundance, potentially, resulting in reductions in effective population size and divergence owing to genetic drift; and dependence on patchily distributed habitat.Weexamine the following two questions: (i) is there subdivision present and, if so, is it concordant with the two marine biogeographic regions separated by Point Conception, and (ii) have cowcod experienced loss of genetic variation owing to population size reduction? Coarse-scale genetic and otolith analyses indicated regional structure across Point Conception. However, analysis of 24 microsatellite DNA loci revealed as many as three cryptic, divergent lineages (FCT = 0.194) that meet south of Point Conception. The two southern lineages had higher growth rate than the northerly distributed lineage. In general, cowcod is the least genetically diverse of 10 rockfishes surveyed with the same markers, but the recent substantial declines in abundance were not reflected by recent genetic bottleneck analyses.},

While dispersal potential is high, previous research on population genetic characteristics of Sebastes species indicates that apparent realized dispersal can be much lower and can exhibit complex patterns of genetic structure. We assayed 812 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and six microsatellite loci in 1000 yellowtail rockfish collected from 21 sites that span the species range from southern California to southeastern Alaska. An abrupt genetic cline near Cape Mendocino, California, splits the range into a northern and southern stock, and is highly concordant between our mitochondrial (FCT = 0.32, p ≪ 0.001) and microsatellite (FCT = 0.02, p ≪ 0.001) datasets. We show that this pattern may be due to a combination of physical (oceanographic or other barriers to larval dispersal), biological (habitat differences), and historical events. This study, and both intra- and inter-specific evidence from other marine species suggests Cape Mendocino demarcates two regions experiencing divergent evolutionary trajectories, and should be considered in management strategies.},

Catch-at-age analyses were done in years 8-20 of a 20-year management horizon, on the basis of 7-19 years of catch-at-age and survey data. Errors in estimated stock size were autocorrelated and were often large in years 8-12 but decreased considerably once about 12-15 years of data were available. For survey CVs of 25-50\%, a precise (±20\%) estimate of stock size was about twice as likely using survey estimates of absolute abundance than of relative abundance. Frequently, similar results were obtained for imprecise, absolute abundance surveys (CV = 50\%) and more precise, relative abundance surveys (CV = 25\%). Because of larger errors in estimating abundance and setting catch quotas, population trajectories varied over a wider range when a relative abundance survey was used. In one case (target fishing mortality rate of 0.25, survey CV of 25\%), linear trends in biomass were estimated reliably using either relative or absolute abundance data.},

	abstract = {The value of big old fat fecund female fish (BOFFFFs) in fostering stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by con- ventional fisheries science and management, although Hjort (1914) indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and mayspawn in different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and age structure of the population. In theworst cases, fishing mortality acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size and age truncation, even if fishing intensity is later reduced. Age truncation is now known to destabilize fished populations, increasing their susceptibility to collapse. Although some fisheries models are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects, most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs.Agrowing body of knowledge dictates that fisheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management conserved old-growth age structure in fished stocks, be it by limiting exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing marine reserves, whicharenowknownto seed surrounding fished areas via larval dispersal. Networks ofmarine reserves are likely to be the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.},

Random forests classification models were used to identify the relative importance of predictor variables (n= 11) for each species and to explore the ability of these variables to accurately predict individual submergence success. Capture depth was identified as the most important variable in predicting yelloweye rockfish submergence but provided little improvement to the quillback rockfish model. The impairment index and the barotrauma sign associated with maximal gas retention were identified as important predictor variables for both yelloweye and quillback rockfish. These findings suggest that the impairment index, unlike capture depth, was able to account for individual variability in submergence success or failure of quillback rockfish. © 2012.},

Since the level of aggressiveness seems to vary between groups, differences in early experience might play a role in determining adult behavior patterns. Laboratory experiments were performed on juveniles captured prior to settlement in which the aggressive tendencies of individuals were assessed by focusing on the development of displays toward a mirror image over a six month period. The results of this study suggest that the repertoire of agonistic behaviors used by adults is available to juveniles though seldom seen in the field. Increased population density and the availability of a shelter increase aggressiveness in S. carnatus and the effects of density were not reversible over the course of the experiment. The behavior of S. chrysomelas was less influenced by the manipulations. © 1987 Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

Metabolic rates of females in this latter stage of gestation were 82\% higher than spent females and 101\% higher than those of non-reproductive males. We determined that 0.08996 cal embryo-1 was consumed during gestation as compared to the change in energy content of embryos from fertilization to birth which was 0.08690 cal embryo-1. The difference between the energy consumed and the energy lost during the 29 d gestation period indicated that extra embryonic sources contributed only 3.4\% or 0.00306 cal embryo-1 of the energy utilized after fertilization.

	abstract = {Tenfold or greater fluctuations in fish recruitment can be precipitated by relatively small variations in mortality rates, growth rates, or stage duration in the early life of fishes. The regulatory process can be subtle; year-class failures or successes need not result from catastrophic or ideal environmental conditions. An analysis of dynamics for five species in the egg, yolk sac larva, larva, and juvenile stages, based based on field, laboratory and enclosure data from the litterature, demonstrated that growth rate variability and its effect on stage durations can be a major factor affecting recruitment level. Recruitments of anchovy-like species, with high larval growth and mortality rates, and relatively large size at metamorphosis, are probably regulated in the larval stage. Cod-like, or herring-like species with slow larval growth, low larval mortality, and relatively small size at metamorphosis could be regulated during the juvenile stage, although control in the larval stage seems more likely. Modest variability in the mortality rates or stage durations during the egg and yolk-sac larva stages exercise relatively little control on recruitment level. A stage-specific analysis of the growth rate variability in early life, which may be more reliable than survey estimation or mortality rates, can provide important insight into fluctuating recruitment levels. Predation is potentially more important than starvation as a regulator of recruitment, even for species that are particulary sensitive to starvation in the larval stage},

	abstract = {Dispersal and speciation in the marine environment have long been key topics in evolutionary biology and more recently in conservation biology. The genus Sebastes, with approximately 110 species, is found throughout most of the world’s cold-temperate seas. Their breadth of phenotypic and species diversity, ecological dominance, and importance to world fisheries has made them a focus of intensive study by countless researchers. In this dissertation, DNA sequence and microsatellite data were used to investigate patterns of speciation, distribution, and mating habits. In Chapter I, DNA sequence data from seven mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, were used to evaluate possible geographic origin, patterns and timing of dispersal, speciation patterns and drivers, and inter-species relationships. The data support a middle xix Miocene origin for Sebastes spp. in deep habitats of the Northwest Pacific followed by dispersal into the Northeast Pacific and eventually into the southern hemisphere, driven by progressive cooling and strengthening of major ocean currents. Previous hypothesized relationships, shown to be mostly poly- or para- phyletic, were revised in light of the findings. Chapter I provided evidence for two new “cryptic” species. In Chapter II, sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, in combination with nine microsatellite loci, was used to evaluate the geographic and bathymetric range of the vermilion rockfish species complex, as well as test for reproductive isolation between the putative species. Genetic analyses supported the presence of two species, separated primarily by depth of adult occurrence. This finding, in association with distribution patterns of 12 recent species pairs, suggests a novel speciation mode based upon the loss/truncation of an ontogenetic migration phase. In Chapter III, DNA sequence data from Chapter II was used to evaluate patterns of population connectivity and gene flow within the vermilion rockfish. A range-wide analysis showed high levels of genetic heterogeneity, likely driven by limited larval dispersal and barriers to gene flow across major oceanographic features. Patterns of paternity and mating system were investigated in Chapter IV using microsatellite loci. Paternity analyses were performed on larvae from both captive and wild populations, representing most major lineages found in Chapter I. Ten of the 17 examined species, showed evidence for multiple sires within a single brood. The implications for genetic diversity produced by this polygynandrous mating system are discussed. 1 I.

	abstract = {The understanding of mating systems is key to the proper management of exploited species, particularly highly fecund, r-selected fishes, which often show strong discrepancies between census and effective population sizes. The development of polymorphic genetic markers, such as codominant nuclear microsatellites, has made it possible to study the paternity of individuals within a brood, helping to elucidate the species' mating system. In the present study, paternity analysis was performed on 35 broods, representing 17 species of the live-bearing scorpaenid genus Sebastes. We report on the finding of multiple paternity from several species of Sebastes and show that at least 3 sires can contribute paternity to a single brood. A phylogenetically and ecologically diverse sample of Sebastes species was examined, with multiple paternity found in 14 of the 35 broods and 10 of the 17 examined species, we suggest that this behavior is not a rare event within a single species and is likely common throughout the genus. Despite high variance in reproductive success, Sebastes spp., in general, show moderate to high levels of genetic diversity. We suggest that multiple paternity may be a form of bet hedging that serves to maximize genetic diversity within broods and that, regardless of the selective value at the level of individual fitness, the net effect at the population level may be a genetic buffer to the consequences of severe overexploitation. © Inter-Research 2008.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary relationships of the livebearing rockfishes of the genus Sebastes have been a point of interest since their original description. With over 65 species found in the northeast Pacific (NEP), 27 in the northwest Pacific (NWP), seven in the Gulf of California (GC), four in the north Atlantic (NA) and at least two in the southern hemisphere (SH), they represent a fascinating lineage for studies of spatial and temporal patterns of dispersal, vicariance and speciation in the marine environment. Previous studies of Sebastes species have attempted to reconstruct their phylogeny using allozyme patterns or portions of a single mitochondrial gene while incompletely sampling the genus, resulting in a partial picture with low statistical support. In this study, genetic analyses using sequence data (5581 characters) from seven mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, tRNA proline, tRNA threonine and the control region) and two nuclear genes (recombination activating gene 2 and internal transcribed spacer 1), along with a near complete sampling of species, have produced a well supported phylogenetic hypothesis of the relationships between Sebastes species as well as clarifying their position within the scorpaenid subfamily, Sebastinae. Though studies of similar magnitude have been conducted at the family and subfamily level, this represents the most detailed and extensive examination of biogeography and marine speciation within a single, widely distributed marine fish genus. Both Bayesian posterior and maximum parsimony analyses produced highly similar phylogenies suggesting an origin for Sebastes at high-latitudes in the NWP. The majority of previously proposed sub-generic groupings based upon morphology are found to be either para- or polyphletic. Using Bayesian-derived genetic distance measures together with rate smoothing techniques, a molecular clock was applied to the phylogeny. The clock-calibrated data suggest that Sebastes originated in the middle Miocene, concordant with fossil data, and began substantial diversification and dispersal in synchrony with high-latitude cooling and establishment of productive upwelling systems across the north Pacific (NP) in the late Miocene. Contrary to contemporary taxonomic criteria that often group Asian and North American species based on common morphology, the molecular phylogenies tend to indicate geographically circumscribed lineages with no evidence for repeated long distance dispersal between disjunct biogeographic provinces (e.g., Asian species nested within a North American lineage). No examples of large-scale glacial vicariance as would be suggested by Asian and North American sibling species were observed. To the contrary, sibling species tended to be in geographic proximity. While occasional long distance dispersal may occur, such as the single colonization of the SH, and thermal barriers presently exist between the NP, NA, GC, and SH taxa, the observable patterns in Sebastes suggest colonization occurs by stepwise invasion of newly available habitat when temperature conditions permit. Colonization events are spread throughout the sub-generic lineages. Vicariant isolation processes may occur on smaller geographic scales perhaps due to local isolating mechanisms such as glacial advance and retreat, sea level change, and ocean currents. Allopatric differences may be enhanced by a tendency for female mate choice and assortative mating in these livebearing species. The ongoing process of thermal advance and retreat is reflected in contemporary patterns of phylogeographic population genetic structure within species and may be enhanced under climate warming.},

The splitting of this species impacts stock size estimates and draws attention to the unintended consequences of current management policies. Differences in exploitation level between the species necessitated an evaluation of population structure and connectivity among regional management segments of the fishery. Analysis of gene flow and calculations of larval dispersal values were accomplished using 782 bp of DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 684 vermilion rockfish sampled from 16 sites between Kyuquot Sound, Canada, and San Quintin, Mexico. Significant genetic heterogeneity was found among sample sites (φST = 0.0742, p {\textless} 0.001 and FST = 0.0899, p {\textless} 0.001). Isolation by distance analysis produced a significant correlation, suggesting low average larval dispersal distance. Analysis of molecular variance showed significant partitioning of genetic variance across the biogeographic boundary at Point Conception (φCT = 0.0923, p {\textless} 0.001 and FCT = 0.0135, p {\textless} 0.001) with additional genetic barriers found at Cape Mendocino, Punta Colnett, Santa Monica Bay, and along the coast of Washington. These genetic barriers conform to oceanographic compartments previously proposed for the California Current Ecological Province and suggest natural management units for this species.},

Along the Pacific coast of North America, there are insufficient stock data for most rockfish species, which compose one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in California. One approach being explored for increasing our understanding of fish distribution patterns and potentially generating stock assessment data over large areas is the use of habitat-based assessment. The general hypothesis is that because rockfish are not randomly distributed across habitats, it should be possible to model and predict their distribution and abundance based on habitat maps and biological data. Furthermore, to the extent that these models are robust and portable, they should be applicable across a variety of locations and physical settings. We attempt to test these hypotheses using predictive models created for two species of rockfish [Sebastes flavidus (yellowtail) and S. rosaceus (rosy)] within Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBMNS). These models, created as part of a recent study, were applied to and tested against distribution data from a previous study of the two species in question at Del Monte shalebeds in Monterey Bay, California. The general linear models (GLMs) were created using rugosity, slope, aspect, depth, and topographic position index analyses of bathymetric digital elevation along with presence/absence data for the two species of rockfish. The model for S. flavidus generated at CBNMS proved to be at least as efficient at predicting yellowtail rockfish distribution at Del Monte as in the setting in which it was created, while the model for S. rosaceus failed to predict rosy rockfish distribution at Del Monte with any reliability.},

	abstract = {Abstract The estimated stock size and recruitment data from assessment models provide a way to evaluate the history of a fishery relative to the expected response given a target fishing mortality rate. For example, if recruitment estimates are below the fishing mortality replacement line, then further reductions in spawning biomass can be expected. However, recruitment variability, serial correlation, and variable historical harvest rates can create misleading perceptions of sustainable harvest rates when they are derived from these simple replacement-line curves. Careful analysis of the stock–recruitment relationship given the available data is required in order to evaluate stock productivity in age-structured modeling. In this study, simulation–estimation procedures were developed to evaluate stock productivity estimates given the level of information and historical fishing mortality currently reported for the Pacific ocean perch Sebastes alutus stock off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California. Two scenarios were designed with significantly different optimum yield calculations, one with moderate productivity and one with relatively low productivity. Within each productivity scenario, two types of simulations were performed, one with recruitment values identical to the original estimates (the observation-error-only case) and one with recruitment varying about the stock–recruitment curve (the observation-and-process-error case). For each of the two scenarios and two cases, 100 simulated stock assessment data sets were generated. Each was then analyzed using the stock assessment model used in 1998. The results suggest that if the actual stock–recruitment productivity of this stock is low, the assessment model estimates will have a slight positive bias (estimated productivity will be higher than actual productivity). Conversely, if the actual stock–recruitment productivity is moderate, estimates are likely to have a negative bias given the observed sequence of recruitments and fishing mortality history. Including time series effects (simple autocorrelation) is shown to be a reasonable step toward remedying this problem.},

Here, we compared two models: a biomass-based food-web model (Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE)) and a size-structured fish community model. The models were compared with respect to predicted ecological consequences of fishing to identify commonalities and differences in model predictions for the California Current fish community. We compared the models regarding direct and indirect responses to fishing on one or more species. The size-based model predicted a higher fishing mortality needed to reach maximum sustainable yield than EwE for most species. The size-based model also predicted stronger top-down effects of predator removals than EwE. In contrast, EwE predicted stronger bottom-up effects of forage fisheries removal. In both cases, the differences are due to the presumed degree of trophic overlap between juveniles of large-bodied fish and adult stages of forage fish. These differences highlight how each model’s emphasis on distinct details of ecological processes affects its predictions, underscoring the importance of incorporating knowledge of model assumptions and limitation, possibly through using model ensembles, when providing model-based scientific advice to policy makers.},

We studied the bathymetric demography and ecology of both species off Oregon and central California. Thornyhead species cannot be characterized as shallow- and deep-living congeners because the peak spawning biomass for both occurred in the oxygen minimum zone at 600-1000 m. Small shortspine thornyhead ({\textless}10 cm) were found in shallow water (200- 600 m) but migrated into deeper water with growth. Longspine thornyhead were oxygen minimum zone specialists found only in deep water (600-1400 m). Shortspine thornyhead grew larger ({\textgreater}70 cm) and appeared to grow throughout their lives. Longspine thornyhead were smaller (25-30 cm) and appeared to have an asymptotic growth pattern with many age groups in the largest size-classes. Bathymetric demography reduces the potential for interspecific competition because shortspine and longspine thornyheads of similar size live at different depths. There are opportunities for refugium management in the fishery because eliminating fishing deeper than 600-800 m would protect the spawning biomass of thornyheads, Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria).},

This study describes the relationship of recreational fish catch trends (all modes, 1980-2000) to environment-species interactions and fishery-independent population data. We used oceanic temperature and upwelling data as indicators of environmental trends, and power-generating-station data on fish impingement as indicators of fishery-independent population trends. Twenty-one dominant species showed significant changes in average catch from the 1980s to 1990s, with three species (shore-caught grass rockfish, Sebastes rastrelliger; boat-caught Pacific bonito, Sarda chiliensis, and olive rockfish, Sebastes serranoides) decreasing significantly both for landings and catch per unit of effort. These declines generally corresponded to a strong negative population response to temperature or a strong positive response to upwelling in southern California, with temperature being more important. Overall, 61\% of 44 species examined had catch or population trends significantly correlated with environmental variables. Fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data trends were similar, with the former lagging the latter by one or more years. Cross-correlation analysis at lags of 0-7 years between the two data sets revealed significant correlations for two croakers and five rockfishes. The results in this study provide a basis for forecasting fish species responses to natural environmental change and thus may facilitate more adaptive management of recreational fisheries.},

Overall 2-day survival of rockfish following recompression in cages was also 68\% (17 species, n = 257). Short-term survival varied across species (range 36\% to 82\%), as did the occurrence of external signs of barotrauma. The degree of external signs of barotrauma was not a significant predictor of initial capture survival or short-term survival. The most significant predictor of short-term survival was surface holding time, with short-term survival increasing with decreasing surface holding time.

It is often unclear whether small-scale, experimental tests of spatial density dependence will accurately describe temporal (between-generation) density dependence required for population regulation. Understanding the mechanisms generating density dependence may provide a link between spatial experiments and temporal regulation of populations. In this study, I manipulated the density of recently settled kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) in both the presence and absence of predators to test for density-dependent mortality and whether predation was the mechanism responsible. I also examined mortality of rockfish cohorts within kelp beds throughout central California to evaluate temporal (between-generation) density dependence in mortality. Experiments suggested that short-term behavioral responses of predators and/or a shortage of prey refuges caused spatial density dependence. Temporal density dependence in mortality was also detected at larger spatial scales for several species of rockfish. It is likely that short-term responses of predators generated both spatial and temporal density dependence in mortality. Spatial experiments that describe the causal mechanisms generating density dependence may therefore be valuable in describing temporal density dependence and population regulation. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, the mechanisms generating density dependence (e.g., predation) are also dynamic processes and may be influenced by local conditions. Understanding the manner in which local habitat features affect the occurrence and/or strength of density dependence will increase our understanding of population dynamics in heterogeneous environments. In this study I conducted two separate field experiments to investigate how local predator density and habitat complexity affect the occurrence and form of density-dependent mortality of juvenile rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). I also used yearly censuses of rockfish populations on nearshore reefs throughout central California to evaluate mortality of juvenile rockfish at large spatial scales. Manipulations of predators (juvenile bocaccio, S. paucispinus) and prey (kelp, gopher, and black-and-yellow [KGB] rockfish, Sebastes spp.) demonstrated that increasing the density of predators altered their functional response and thus altered patterns of density dependence in mortality of their prey. At low densities of predators, the number of prey consumed per predator was a decelerating function, and mortality of prey was inversely density dependent. However, at high densities of predators, the number of prey killed per predator became an accelerating response, and prey mortality was directly density dependent. Results of field experiments and large-scale surveys both indicated that the strength of density-dependent mortality may also be affected by the structural complexity of the habitat. In small-scale field experiments, increased habitat complexity increased the strength of density-dependent mortality. However, at large scales, increasing complexity resulted in a decrease in the strength of density dependence. I suggest that these differences resulted from scale-dependent changes in the predatory response that generated mortality. Whether increased habitat complexity leads to an increase or a decrease in the strength of density-dependent mortality may depend on how specific predatory responses (e.g., functional or aggregative) are altered by habitat complexity. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that rates of demographic density dependence and the resulting dynamics of local populations may largely depend upon attributes of the local habitat. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {The addition of juveniles to marine populations (termed “recruitment”) is highly variable due to variability in the survival of fish through larval and juvenile stages. Recruitment estimates are often large or small for several years in a row (termed “autocorrelated” recruitment). Autocorrelated recruitment can be due to numerous factors, but typically is attributed to multi-year environmental drivers affecting early life survival rates. Estimating the magnitude of recruitment autocorrelation within a stock assessment model and examinations on its effect on the quality of forecasts of spawning biomass within stock assessments is uncommon. We used a simulation experiment to evaluate the estimability of autocorrelation within a stock assessment model over a range of levels of autocorrelation in recruitment deviations. The precision and accuracy of estimated autocorrelation, and the ability of an integrated age-structured stock assessment framework to forecast the dynamics of the system, were compared for scenarios where the autocorrelation parameter within the assessment was fixed at zero, fixed at its true value, internally estimated within the integrated model, or input as a fixed value determined using an external estimation procedure that computed the sample autocorrelation of estimated recruitment deviations. Internal estimates of autocorrelation were biased toward extreme values (i.e., towards 1.0 when true autocorrelation was positive and −1.0 when true autocorrelation was negative). Estimates of autocorrelation obtained from the external estimation procedure were nearly unbiased. Forecast performance was poor (i.e., true biomass outside the predictive interval for the forecasted biomass) when autocorrelation was ignored, but was non-zero in the simulation. Applying the external estimation procedure generally improved forecast performance by decreasing forecast error and improving forecast interval coverage. However, estimates of autocorrelation were shown to degrade when fewer than 40 years of recruitment estimates were available.},

	volume = {110},
	issn = {00900656},
	abstract = {Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are an important component of North Pacific marine ecosystems and commercial fisheries. Because the rocky, high-relief substrate that rockfishes often inhabit is inaccessible to standard survey trawls, population abundance assessments for many rockfish species are difficult. As part of a large study to classify substrate and compare complementary sampling tools, we investigated the feasibility of using an acoustic survey in conjunction with a lowered stereo-video camera, a remotely operated vehicle, and a modified bottom trawl to estimate rockfish biomass in untrawlable habitat. The Snakehead Bank south of Kodiak Island, Alaska, was surveyed repeatedly over 4 days and nights. Dusky rockfish (S. variabilis), northern rockfish (S. polyspinis), and harlequin rockfish (S. variegatus) were the most abundant species observed on the bank. Backscatter attributed to rockfish were collected primarily near the seafloor at a mean height off the bottom of 1.5 m. Total rockfish backscatter and the height of backscatter off the bottom did not differ among survey passes or between night and day. Biomass estimates for the 41 square nautical-mile area surveyed on this small, predominantly untrawlable bank were 2350 metric tons (t) of dusky rockfish, 331 t of northern rockfish, and 137 t of harlequin rockfish. These biomass estimates are 5-60 times the density estimated for these rockfish species by a regularly conducted bottom trawl survey covering the bank and the surrounding shelf. This finding shows that bottom trawl surveys can underestimate the abundance of rockfishes in untrawlable areas and, therefore, may underestimate overall population abundance for these species.},

Moreover, early life history information is sparse for many species. We used data from 14 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of young-of-the-year Pacific ocean perch collected during 1998-2003 from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. Broad-scale geographic variation in genetic structure of the young-of-the-year (FST = 0.005, P {\textless} 10-4) had similarities to that observed in a previous adult study. The overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation by distance) was nearly identical to that observed in the adults. Fine-scale geographic divergence was also observed and may be the result of oceanographic circulation features within the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variation (between cohorts) at locations sampled in more than one year is consistent with variable oceanography and fine-scale population structure rather than the influence of a sweepstakes effect. The similarities of the young-of-the-year with the adults and the pattern of genetic divergence confirm that dispersal of Pacific ocean perch is limited in all life stages. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

It has been suggested that variable spacing between reserves is essential to the success of a system of marine reserves. We used numerical models to examine the effect of variable spacing on the efficacy of marine reserves for managing a fish species with sedentary adults and planktonic larvae. Variability in reserve spacing affected catch and recruitment relative to values for a uniform configuration of reserves only for populations near collapse even in the presence of a system of reserves. For species with low fishing rates or large marine reserves, variability in spacing had only a minor effect. At high fishing rates and small reserve sizes, variable reserve placement had a positive local effect on catch and recruitment when several reserves fell close to each other. These configurations led to uneven spatial distributions with greater catch and recruitment in areas with a higher concentration of reserves. Variable reserve spacing can offer additional protection to overfished populations along certain sections of the coastline, but concern for spatial homogeneity will argue for a uniform distribution of reserves covering an adequate proportion of the entire coastline. © 2005 NRC.},

Here we couple possible catch scenarios under an IFQ scheme with ocean acidification impacts on shelled benthos and plankton, using an Atlantis ecosystem model for the US West Coast. IFQ harvest scenarios alone, in most cases, did not have strong impacts on the food web, beyond the direct effects on harvested species. However, when we added the impacts of ocean acidification, the abundance of commercially important groundfish such as English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus) declined up to 20\%-80\%, owing to the loss of shelled prey items from their diet. English sole exhibited a 10-fold decline in potential catch and economic yield when confronted with strong acidification impacts on shelled benthos. Therefore, it seems prudent to complement IFQs with careful consideration of potential global change effects such as acidification. Our analysis provides an example of how new ecosystem modeling tools that evaluate cumulative impacts can be integrated with established management reference points and decision mechanisms.},

The ocean migration patterns and catch rates of this stock are thought to closely resemble Oregon’s north migrating Chinook from coastal basins ranging from the Necanicum River in the north to the Siuslaw River in the south. A relatively long and continuous history of mark and recapture experiments with corresponding extensive spawning ground surveys and harvest estimates from a fresh water creel, serves as the foundation for a predictive model of spawner abundance. Peak counts from two spawning ground surveys were identified as an index that strongly correlates with relatively precise abundance estimates derived from a Peterson two event mark-recapture model. Index surveys are less labor intensive than previous mark-recapture activities, and evidence suggests they are an efficient and cost effective method to estimate spawner abundance. 1},

	url = {http://www.psmfc.org/~wade/pub/bull176/bull176.htm},
	abstract = {Our study focused on the status of the marine recreational fishery along the northern and central California coast, where surveys of recreational fishing effort and catch were conducted from 1958-61 and from 1981-86. Between the two surveys, annual recreational fishing effort rose from 1.6 million fishing days to 2.7 million fishing days. Nearly all the increase was due to increases in fishing from boats (commercial passenger fishing vessels and private/rental boats). Annual recreational catch rose from 3.9 million fish weighing 2700 metric tons to 6.5 million fish weighing 5400 metric tons. The average number of fish caught per day decreased for fishing from piers (1.9 to 1.6), other shore areas (1.7 to 1.1), and private/rental boats (2.8 to 2.4), and increased from commercial passenger fishing vessels (5.4 to 6.0). The variety of different fish species caught in a typical day of fishing from boats decreased, but variety from shore increased. Direct expenditures in the fishery from 1981-86 were about \$160 million per year (1992 dollars). Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) dominated the catch from boats in both surveys. Between the two surveys, recreational catch of rockfish rose from 1.3 million fish to 3.4 million fish, while average weight per rockfish decreased from 0.82 kg to 0.71 kg. Average weight decreased in 12 of 16 major rockfish species. The 12 species were mainly shallow-water ({\textless}73 m) species or species with wide depth ranges. The catch from boats shifted towards a higher proportion of deep-water ({\textgreater}73 m) species. Signs of population stress were found in blue rockfish S. mystinus (decrease in catch), canary rockfish S. pinniger and yellowtail rockfish S. flavidus (decrease in mean length in recreational and trawl catches and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch), and brown rockfish S. auriculatus (decrease in mean length and high incidence of sexually immature fish in recreational catch). Abrupt declines in lengths of blue rockfish and yellowtail rockfish occurred in central California between 1983 and 1984. Declines reflect mortalities that may in part be attributed to effects of the 1982-83 El Niño event. Mean weight per rockfish decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (1.13 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0.48 kg) in 1980-86. The major species generally had smaller fish and fewer successful year-classes in central California than northern California. Catches of lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, a trophy species of importance to both boat and shore fishing, have been in slow oscillating decline since the early 1970s. It is unclear whether the decline is due to overharvest and is a long-term trend that will continue, or if it is due to natural population fluctuations. Fishes of the surfperch family (Embiotocidae) dominated catch from shore in both surveys. Of the fish groups we examined, the surfperch showed the greatest evidence of decline. Between the surveys, the weight of sport catch of surfperches declined by 54\% and the weight of commercial catch declined by 26\%. Barred surfperch Amphistichus argenteus and redtail surfperch A. rhodoterus (the two most important surfperches by number and weight landed), and also striped seaperch Embiotoca lateralis showed substantial decreases in recreational catch and average weight per fish. Commercial landings of redtail surfperch in the Eureka area declined by 54\% from 1953 through 1992, despite a rise in price per pound. Commercial landings of barred surfperch in the Santa Barbara area rose by 118\% from 1953 through 1992, perhaps due to a rise in price per pound. White seaperch Phanerodon furcatus stocks may have collapsed prior to the 1958-61 survey. Like rockfish, mean weight per surfperch decreased in a north-to-south cline from Del Norte/Humboldt (0.33 kg) to San Luis Obispo (0.22 kg) in 1980-86. Populations of lingcod and five of six rockfishes examined for interannual length-frequency trends were found to be subject to wide variation in recruitment from year to year. Strong year-classes often dominated a species' catch for several consecutive years. Strong year-classes were not found to be established in the 1957-58 and 1982-83 El Niño periods. Ten pelagic fish species (albacore Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna T. obesus, bluefin tuna T. thynnus, bullet mackerel Auxis rochei, Pacific mackerel Scomber japonicus, Pacific bonito Sarda chiliensis, skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis, yellowfin tuna T. albacares, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, and California barracuda Sphyraena argentea) showed obvious northward shifts in the sampled recreational catch during the 1982-83 El Niño event. Eighteen other species showed less pronounced changes that may have been related to El Niño.},

Standardized Δ14C measurements are particularly useful when researchers suspect that environmental and biological differences between the validation samples and the reference chronology may exist that affect the level, but not the timing, of Δ14C in the samples. These new methods can be applied simultaneously. Two previous bomb radiocarbon studies on canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger) and black drum (Pogonias cromis) were reanalyzed, further illustrating the usefulness of these new methods. © 2008 NRC.},

Following closure, no fishery-independent monitoring took place for groundfishes within the CCAs through 2013. To assess the impact of the closures, we sampled multiple sites inside and outside CCAs from 2014 to 2016 via the Northwest Fisheries Science Center’s Hook and Line Survey. We investigated variations in catch per unit effort (CPUE), size, length frequency and percent of sites with positive catch for 14 abundant groundfishes (bank, bocaccio, chilipepper, copper, cowcod, greenspotted, lingcod, olive, rosy, speckled, squarespot, starry, swordspine and the vermilion-sunset complex). General linear models that included area, year, depth and distance from port revealed significantly greater CPUE inside CCAs for 11 species. CPUE for lingcod, copper rockfish and vermilion-sunset was significantly or near-significantly lower inside the CCAs. We saw significant or near-significant differences in size (12 species) and length-frequency distributions (10 species), with larger fish present inside CCAs. The percentage of sites positive for individual species tended to be greater inside CCAs (11 species). We also observed significantly elevated species richness (species per site) and total CPUE inside CCAs. Results indicate larger individuals and greater CPUE for multiple rockfishes inside CCAs either as a result of effective management or perhaps pre-existing conditions.},

Based on regression analyses, populations were subdivided into two depth strata (55-122m and 122-450m) and four geographic regions (48°10'N-48°28'N, 40°26'N-48°10'N, 34°27'N-40°26'N, and 32°30'N-34°27'N) and differences in length, age, and growth examined by gender. Strong evidence of variation in weight-length relationships was found north and south of Cape Mendocino (40°26'N) but little variation was noted for depth or gender. In contrast, variations in von Bertalanffy growth models were highly dimorphic between sexes with consistent patterns across depth and geographic regions. Females grew more slowly and reached larger asymptotic sizes (L ∞, cm) relative to males in all regions examined. Asymptotic size for both males and females tended to increase at higher latitude and increased depth. However, the smallest asymptotic sizes occurred in the region from Pt. Conception to Cape Mendocino, CA (34°27'N-40°26'N), rather than lower latitudes south of Pt. Conception (32°30'N-34°27'N).

The relationships of Sebastes to other scorpaeniform fishes as well as the relationships of scorpaeniforms to other fishes are not resolved. Of the 102 species of Sebastes worldwide, 69 species have been illustrated as preflexion larvae, 35 as postflexion larvae and 65 as pelagic juveniles. Morphological characters of each of these stages were used to compare species, group them by similar appearances and then compare these groupings with existing subgenera. Some pigment patterns of preflexion larvae were rather consistent among species within certain subgenera but quite variable among species in other subgenera. Postflexion larvae fell into 11 groups based on pigment, head spines and body shape. These groups were not closely aligned with the subgeneric assignments of the component species. On the basis of pigment patterns of pelagic juveniles, six groups were evident, but the specific composition of these groups bore little resemblance to either the larval or subgeneric groups. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Radiocarbon values from the first year's growth of 43 yelloweye rockfish otoliths plotted against estimated birth year produced a14C time series (1940-1990) for these waters. The initial rise of14C occurred in 1958 and14C levels rose to peak values (60-70‰) between 1966 and 1971, with a subsequent declining trend through the end of the record in 1990 (-3.2‰). In addition, the14C data confirmed the longevity of the yelloweye rockfish to a minimum of 44 years and strongly support higher age estimates. This14C time series will be useful for the interpretation of14C accreted in biological samples from these waters.},

	abstract = {Stock: This is the first assessment of gopher rockfish (Sebastes carnatus) and is restricted to the portion of the stock north of Point Conception (lat. 34 o 30′ N). There is evidence that supports differences in size and growth of gopher rockfish in southern California that indicates the need for a separate assessment on the southern California segment. Life history information for the southern segment is not known. Catches: Catches of gopher rockfish in northern California (north of Point Conception) were classified into two fisheries, commercial and recreational. Gopher rockfish are primarily taken with hook-and-line gears in both fisheries. Commercial landings from 1969-1977 came from California's Commercial Fisheries Information System (CFIS, landing receipts). From 1978-2004, California Cooperative Survey (CALCOM) expansion estimates were used. There were minimal, if any, landings reported in the commercial fishery from 1984-1988. The assumption was made that this was due to the introduction of the group gopher market category during that time. Therefore, we applied CALCOM species compositions in the 1980s to CFIS landings for estimates in those years. Recreational landings from 1969-1982 were estimated by ratio of sums to commercial landings in the 1980s time period. From 1983-2004, Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN) estimates for gopher rockfish were used. There were no estimates in RecFIN from 1990-1995 data for Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFVs) and no 1990-1992 estimates for shore-based and private boats. Therefore, we used CPFV estimates from the Northern and Central California CPFV Sportfish Survey (CDFG) while estimates for shore-based and private boats were based on historical averages from 1990-1992. Es timated discards were included in the recreational catches.},

Using an alternate haul, randomized block design, we compared catches between a commonly used combination trawl and a newly designed, low-rise trawl incorporating a "cutback" headrope. For most of the target flatfish species, the experimental trawl had a 25-59\% higher catch rate (kilograms) than the control net (P {\textless} 0.05), consistent with greater footrope length in the experimental trawl. Increased catches of some small rockfish, skates, and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) were also observed (P {\textless} 0.05). The catches of many larger roundfish and rockfish species, including canary rockfish (Sebastes pinniger), redstripe rockfish (Sebastes proriger), Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and shortspine thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) more than 25 cm long, were reduced from 34 to 97\% in the experimental trawl (P {\textless} 0.05). Under weak-stock management conditions, in which the bycatch of overfished rockfish species limits directed flatfish fisheries, trawl designs that permit nontarget species to escape before entrainment can significantly reduce bycatch mortality and prevent premature closures of directed flatfish fisheries.},

The user defines the joint likelihood for the data and the random effects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

The present checklist hopefully will assist other researchers in the identification of the fishes of Monterey Bay. The reference list also provides a brief historical review of the ichthyological research on fishes in the area. AREA OF COVERAGE The Monterey Bay area was defined as the region south of Pigeon Point (37 10' N), north of Polnt Sur (36 20' N), and between 121 50' W and 1220 30' W. These limits were not rigidly maintained for deep water fishes that were collected near the boundaries. The Elkhorn Slough, San Lorenzo, Pajaro and Salinas River areas in-elude the complete drainage into the respective slough or rivers. Elkhorn Slough is further divided into three areas whenever it is possiblE to determine the site of fish collection. These three areas are the following: the north arm of Elkhorn Slough from a line drawn between Skipper's Cafe and the north jetty, to the north end of Bennett Slough; the south arm of Elkhorn Slough from a line drawn between the south side of the Highway 1 bridge and the south jetty to Potrero Road; the central part of the sloughis the region between the jetties and the remaining part of Elkhorn Slough east of the Highway 1 bridge.},

Hook-and-line surveys allow for the collection of biological information, but the resultant indices of abundance may be biased. We designed simulations to address concerns around survey design, hook saturation, and competition among species and found that catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined more slowly than population size across all scenarios. This hyperstability was most prominent when fish were found in high-density patches, and these scenarios have median absolute relative error values roughly three to five times greater than those with more even distributions of fish density. Despite hyperstability, the surveys still had statistical power to detect changes in abundance. Interspecific competition for hooks caused bias in survey results when one species was more aggressive than another. Taken together, our results indicate hook-and-line surveys fill a niche in survey methodologies, but their use and interpretation can be challenged by hyperstability and competition among species.},

	abstract = {Catch share systems are generally expected to increase economic rents in fisheries by increasing harvest efficiency, reducing capital costs through consolidation, and increasing the value of landed catch. However, these benefits may have costs, as consolidation and the potential for associated change in spatial distribution in landings can hinder social objectives such as maintaining access for fishery-dependent communities and small owner-operators. Achievement of such fishery management objectives are determined by changes in fisher behavior, which may be complex and difficult to predict. Predicting fisher behavior is particularly challenging in multispecies fisheries, in which the mix of species is a determinant of where and when fishing effort and landings occur. We evaluate changes in overall fishing effort, species targeting, and determinants of fishing location choice in response to catch shares in the US West Coast Groundfish Trawl Fishery. We found reductions in total fishing effort, increased targeting of some species, and no evidence of spatial effort concentration. Key determinants of location choice (distance, expected revenue, and recently fished locations) were similar among time periods, but after catch shares there was more avoidance of areas that lacked recent fishing activity or associated information with which to develop expectations of catch and bycatch. Additionally, location choice remained constant with up to 100-fold financial penalties on bycatch species.},

A total of 112 rockfish were collected from both sites over 5 years (1993, 1994, 2001, 2002, and 2003). Total age, settlement date, age at settlement, and birth date were determined from otolith microstructure. Fish off Mendocino settled mostly in June and fish off Monterey settled mostly in May (average difference in settlement=23 days). Although the difference in the timing of settlement followed this same pattern for both areas over the five years, settlement occurred later in 2002 and 2003 than in the prior years of sampling. The difference in the timing of settlement was due primarily to differences in birth dates for the two areas. The time of settlement was positively related to upwelling and negatively related to sea level anomaly for most of the months before settlement. Knowledge of the timing of settlement has implications for design and placement of marine protected areas because protection of nursery grounds is frequently a major objective of these protected areas. The timing of settlement is also an important consideration in the planning of surveys of early recruits because mistimed surveys (caused by latitudinal differences in the timing of settlement) could produce biased estimates.},

Pelagic juveniles developed a prominent pigment pattern of three body bars that did not extend to the ventral surface. Species identification was confirmed subsequently by using mitochondrial sequence data of four representative specimens of various sizes. As determined from the examination of otoliths, the growth rate of larval and pelagic juvenile pygmy rockfish was 0.28 mm/day, which is relatively slow in comparison to the growth rate of other species of Sebastes.

Differences in fish detection, identification, and measurements were observed between vehicles (e.g., densities of unidentified fishes, unidentified rockfishes, and unidentified species of Sebastomus were significantly higher in ROV surveys). Species most closely associated with the seafloor were observed at higher densities in HOV surveys than in ROV surveys—a result possibly due to the greater reactions of fish to the ROV. The percentage of fish for which we could not estimate size was greater from video images collected with the ROV than from in situ observations made from the HOV. Results of our study will be useful for evaluation of the limitations and biases of these survey vehicles in assessments of demersal fishes.},

Fish in the first category were regarded as territorial, since their home ranges were defended and relatively exclusive. Because individuals did not patrol borders, however, territories often overlapped at their peripheries. In addition, some territory holders appeared to tolerate the sheltering of other fish within their territories, as long as these intruders left the territory during periods of activity. Some fish with discontinuous home ranges ("commuters") may have been territorial, but others may have been forced to occupy suboptimal feeding areas. Fish in the third category ("floaters") were regarded as nonterritorial; their activities were apparently limited to areas where they could escape the aggression of territory holders. The varying patterns appeared to develop through defense and accommodation during the turnover of individuals, with each fish securing shelter and feeding areas as these became available. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Seasonal cycles of reserve deposition and utilization in many fishes, amphibians and reptiles alleviate temporal mismatches of energy supply and demand. Utilization of reserves can be related to maintenance during periods of reduced food supply, to reproduction, particularly during periods of poor food availability, and to migration. Published data on the seasonal cycles of reserves and reproduction in Sebastes suggest that reserves are important for maintenance during wintertime periods of low food availability. Unlike many other ectothermic vertebrates, some species of Sebastes deposit fat reserves at the same time as gametogenesis, a pattern consistent with the longevity and iteroparity evident in the genus. Other species of Sebastes have similar seasonal timing of fat cycles, but since reproduction takes place later in the year, the decline in reserves during winter coincides with the main period of reproductive activity. The significance of this is not clear. Interspecific differences in amounts of reserves may be related to geographical differences in the seasonality or abundance of food. Intraspecific variation in reserves, marked most strongly by allometry of reserves with regard to fish legth, bears further study, since it may link the proces of sexual maturation and the responses of repeat spawners to variability in food supply and other environmental factors. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {Many species of central California rockfishes conclude their pelagic stage during the spring-summer upwelling period, when advection of surface waters could carry them away from nearshore postpelagic habitats. We examined the distributions of late-stage pelagic juvenile rockfish in April and May/June of 1987 and 1988, based on midwater-trawl surveys between Point Reyes and Monterey Bay, California. Distributional patterns were complex, and changed rapidly with changing oceanographic conditions and with changes in species and size composition. The smallest pelagic juveniles often appeared offshore, in the region of the upwelling front, which suggested that they had been advected offshore at some time during upwelling. However, few pelagic juveniles were found offshore of the upwelling front. Larger pelagic juveniles were often found close to shore, even when upwelling was active. This suggests that later-stage pelagic juveniles undergo behavioral changes that enable them to move toward shore or remain there in spite of upwelling. We also found evidence of more passive advection and retention of pelagic juveniles of all sizes, including onshore movement during relaxation of upwelling. It appears that relaxation of upwelling may be a sufficient but not necessary aspect of the settlement of juvenile rockfish from pelagic to postpelagic habitats. If so, advection during upwelling may not have a negative effect on the settlement and ultimate recruitment of rockfish.},

	abstract = {Rockfishes of the genus Sebastes comprise one of the most important and heavily utilized groups of commercial and recreational fishes occurring off California. In this study, carried out primarily in the 1980s, we examined various aspects of life history for the nearshore rockfishes and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod off central California. The following species of rockfishes were those primarily considered within this study: black, black-and-yellow, blue, canary, China, copper, gopher, grass, green spotted, kelp, olive, rosy, starry, vermilion, yelloweye, and yellowtail. During the study, 21 species of rockfish and 8 additional species of fish, including cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod, were tagged and released to study patterns of movement. Of 7332 tagged fish, 197 (3\%) representing 15 species, were recaptured. Of these, only three species (canary and yellowtail rockfishes and lingcod) manifested substantial movement. Most nearshore rockfishes appear to be highly residential. Age and growth parameters were determined for 15 species of rockfish. Whole otoliths were the primary structure utilized for ageing. Most nearshore rockfishes examined appear to have lifespans of moderate longevity, with maximum ages between 20 and 30 years. Weight-length relationships were calculated for 16 species of rockfish and for cabezon, kelp greenling, and lingcod. Reproductive patterns were determined for 18 species of rockfish and size at sexual maturation for 17 of these species. The majority of nearshore rockfishes appear to release larvae during the winter-spring period. However, timing of larval extrusion is species specific and must be examined on a case-by-case basis. General food habits were described for 11 species of rockfish. An Appendix, summarizing life-history characteristics for the 17 most commonly encountered species in this study, is included. We conclude that the nearshorerockfishes are a valuable marine resource to the State of California and should be managed with the realization that, as with many of the world's fishery resources, they are vulnerable to human impacts and over exploitation},

Two multivariate methods, detrended correspondence analysis and Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis, were used to derive species ordinations and groupings. A general linear model developed for the primary detrended correspondence analysis axis scores showed that the species compositions were strongly correlated with depth and minimally correlated with the other environmental variables examined (latitude, month, and year). However, there were distinct seasonal changes in species composition at the shallower depths, consistent with the movement of deepwater species onto the shelf during summer. Annual trends in the species compositions were not evident even though the study region is very dynamic oceanographically and was heavily fished during the study period.},

Often, length and weight data are available as sets of length measurements and aggregated sample weights, and the aggregate average weight of a sample can be expressed as the average of the weights predicted for the individual fish lengths. This study evaluated the feasibility of applying nonlinear regression to aggregated length-weight data. Experiments with simulated random length-weight data demonstrated that the estimates of parameter b appear to be unbiased and the estimates of a are right-skewed and biased. Further, the estimates of In(a) and b are almost perfectly correlated. The precision and accuracy of the estimates were greatly influenced by the number of aggregate samples but were relatively unaffected by the number of fish in each sample. An additional experiment showed that the residuals from the regression can be used to detect small changes in the length-weight parameters. © 2005 NRC Canada.},

In this analysis, the reproductive strategy for this species was revisited, fecundity estimates were updated, and size-dependent fecundity relationships were established from fish collected off California and the Pacific Northwest. Results of histological analysis indicate that petrale sole exhibit a determinate batch spawning strategy, with potential annual fecundity (PAF) set prior to the release of eggs over the course of several spawning events. Both PAF and relative PAF (weight-specific fecundity) increased significantly with maternal length and weight. Regional differences in the strength of the relationship between relative PAF and size indicate that the maternal effect is stronger in the Pacific Northwest; however, more data are necessary to confirm regional patterns. Because reproductive output was not proportionate with female size, fisheries managers should consider using relative PAF in determining the reproductive potential of this stock.},

Notable exceptions include bocac- cio (most abundant at 13 m) and blue, yellowtail, and pygmy rockfishes (most abundant at 117 m). With the advent of persistent upwelling during May and June, pelagic juvenile rockfish tend to occur deeper in the water column than in March-April.

Restriction site variation in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 and 4 genes and the 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA genes were used to evaluate their relationships.

During historical periods of declining mean trophic level, catches of upper trophic level taxa either increased or remained steady, contrary to the predictions of the "fishing down the food web" hypothesis. Further, a climate index was highly correlated (r = 0.69-0.97) with mean trophic level and (or) the related fisheries in balance (FIB) index across climate regime shifts in the 1940s and 1970s, indicating that climate effects, particularly on high trophic level taxa, can act as the major driver of variability in these parameters.

	abstract = {Worldwide fisheries decline has spurred the utilization of new conservation and management approaches, including the implementation of marine reserves. The diversity of goals and expected outcomes should guide the marine reserve design process, coupled with a thorough understanding of the ecology of all species targeted for protection. Central California’s network of coastal marine protected areas (MPAs) was established in an environment of some uncertainty regarding the expected outcomes for temperate nearshore fish species, especially the Sebastes genus (rockfishes). Movement behavior of temperate reef-fishes plays an important role in the level of protection that a reserve will afford a species. Consistent small-scale movements ({\textless}10 km) and limited home range sizes decrease the likelihood that individuals will encounter fishing mortality. Conversely, large-scale movements outside of reserve boundaries may contribute to fisheries in surrounding waters (‘spillover’). The current study sought to further elucidate the movement behavior of some shallow-water temperate reef fish species throughout California’s central coast, with goals of providing useful data for future MPA design processes. Tag-and-recapture methodology was utilized in order to observe fish movements, centered on a public participation program for acquiring information on recaptured tagged fishes. A total of v 476 fishes representing 14 species were recaptured from a sample of 37,111 tagged (1.3\%) over a five-year period spanning 2005-2009. The majority (75\%) of distances traveled were less than one kilometer, however some species made consistent far-ranging travels on the order of hundreds of kilometers as well. Analyses of factors with potential for shaping movement behavior included geographic variation, source of recapture data, gear type, days at liberty, length, initial capture depth, handling condition, and fish density. Additionally, the applicability of tag-and-recapture methodology is examined as an effective source of fish movement information. The results of this research corroborate findings of previous studies as well as provide new insight into the movement patterns of some nearshore temperate reef species.},

Such increases in the density of potential competitors can cause generalist predators to contract the scope of their diets. This study investigated the effects of increased conspecific fish density on the diets of gopher rockfish Sebastes carnatus at a 35 yr old MPA in Point Lobos, California, and at 4 newly established MPAs in Año Nuevo, Point Lobos, Piedras Blancas, and Point Buchon in central California. Analyses were conducted for 707 stomachs collected from 2007 to 2009. Diets did not differ inside versus outside the old Point Lobos MPA in terms of prey richness, evenness, composition, or gopher rockfish trophic level. However, fish outside the MPA had greater levels of individual specialization. No consistent differences in these metrics were observed inside versus outside the 4 new MPAs, although prey composition and evenness did differ significantly among geographic locations. Diets at Año Nuevo, the most northern and shallow location, consisted predominantly of Cancer spp. and porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae), while diets from southern, deeper locations were dominated by brittle stars (Ophiuroidea). The case study of the old Point Lobos MPA indicates that fish feeding ecology may not change in an MPA after several decades. Differences in prey observed among geographic locations suggest variation in the community composition among central California's new MPAs, which may influence the effect of each MPA on food web dynamics over time.},

	abstract = {This paper serves as an introduction to a symposium on the role that California oil and gas platforms serve as habitats for fishes and invertebrates. As of 2019, there are 27 platforms in state and federal waters off California, and the decommissioning of some of these platforms is imminent. Thus, consideration of whether to completely remove a platform or cut it off at some depth below the sea surface and retain the submerged portion as a reef is a decision that will occur in the near future. The objectives of the 10 papers in this dedicated issue of the Bulletin of Marine Science are to: (1) increase scientific understanding of the inter- and intrarelationships of fish and invertebrate populations at offshore oil and gas platforms and natural reefs within the Southern California Bight; (2) determine the extent of influence of platform assemblages on southern California and the Pacific coast populations of fishes and invertebrates; and (3) synthesize relevant reports, existing peer-reviewed literature, and new data analyses into a single peer-reviewed reference. This introductory paper contains a synopsis of all extant California platforms including information on: (1) the original operator, (2) the current operator of records, (3) the date the platform was installed, (4) the first production date, (5) the platform's distance from shore [including whether it is state or outer continental shelf (OCS) waters], (6) the bottom depth of the platform, (7) the number of well slots, (8) the number of conductors, (9) what the platform produces (oil and/or gas), (10) the platform jacket dimensions [generally at the seafloor (bottom)], (11) the platform's footprint, (12) the midwater surface area, (13) the total removal weight, (14) the platform location, (15) the shell mound size, (16) the shell mound volume, (17) the shell mound height, (18) the center of the shell mound location, and (19) the bottom slope. In addition, we present an overview of all previous research on the biology and ecology of California platform organisms.},

	abstract = {Decommissioning alternatives regarding offshore oil platforms include leaving some or all of the platform structure in place. However, despite the high numbers of fishes that can reside around offshore platforms, little is known about the comparative ecological performance of fishes living on platforms compared to those inhabiting natural habitats. It would be expected that sites where fishes exhibited better growth, increased reproduction, or greater survival rates would be beneficial to regional fish populations. We determined and compared the birthdate distributions and daily growth rates of 116 young-of-the-year (YOY) blue rockfish (Sebastes mystinus Jordan and Gilbert, 1881) among two platforms and two natural reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel region. We found a significant though modest lunar pattern in birthdates where blue rockfish produced (or successfully recruited) more larvae in the week leading up to the full moon. Mean growth rates were significantly different across sites. At one of the two site pairs (platform-natural reef), YOY rockfish growth rates were significantly higher at the platform habitat; there was no statistical difference in growth rates between fish living at the other site pair. This study demonstrates that, as measured by daily growth rates, blue rockfish living around oil and gas production platforms may perform at least as well as those fish living on natural reefs, and supports previous research implying that some platforms may benefit regional fish populations. © 2007 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews current knowledge of substrate-associated juvenile Sebastes. In general, juvenile rockfish recruit to shallower depths than those occupied by conspecific adults. Habitat use by newly recruited rockfish differs markedly among species. While a few species recruit to shallow-dwelling macrophytes, such as Zostera, many others recruit to larger brown algae, such as Nereocystis and Macrocystis. A few deeper dwelling species recruit to low relief or soft substrata. However, little is known on recruitment of these deeper dwellers. Crustaceans are the major component of the diets of newly recruited Sebastes. Species which continue to forage in the water column shift to larger crustaceans (e.g. euphausids) and fish as they grow. Species which shift to substrate-associated prey soon begin to feed on larger algal-associated gammarid amphipods, shrimps and isopods. Field studies indicate variation in intraspecific growth rates over large geographic distances, among nearby sites and among algal habitats on the same reef, with food availability and water temperature being major factors in the differences. In particular, laboratory studies have shown that temperature is one of the most important factors in growth rates. Many species of juvenile rockfish make ontogenetic movements, often moving into deeper water as they age. Most seasonal movements appear to be related to changes in water temperature and turbulence. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

A total of 1,526,437 fishes were observed. Fish densities were highest around platform bases, followed by platform midwaters, shell mounds, and natural habitats. Of all fishes observed, 90.4\% were in the genus Sebastes. Water depth was the strongest driver of the fish species assemblages, although habitat type and geographic location were also important. Most of the fishes living around platforms and natural habitats were relatively small, primarily ≥20 cm in length. Many of these individuals were the juveniles of larger taxa or the juveniles and adults of dwarf species. Larger fishes were less common and these were most often found around platform bases and on natural habitats. Most young-of-the-year (YOY) fishes occurred at water depths of ≥150 m at all four habitats. At platforms, YOY densities were highest in platform midwaters and bases. On average, densities of these young fishes were somewhat higher compared to natural habitats and it is likely that many, although not all, California platforms play a significant role as nursery grounds for a variety of fishes, particularly for a number of Sebastes species.},

If significant contamination is occurring, it would be expected to impair the reproductive abilities of impacted fishes. One form of reproductive impairment is atresia, the abnormal reabsorption of oocytes that are destined to be spawned. Atresia has been widely used as an indicator of pollutant-related reproductive impairment in fishes. We examined the occurrence of atretic oocytes in Pacific sanddab, Citharichthys sordidus, collected near two offshore platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel (B and Gilda) and from two natural reference sites (off the east end of Santa Cruz Island and in mid-channel off Rincon). While pronounced atresia was observed in a few fish at one natural site and one platform, there was no evidence of widespread pronounced atresia at any of the four sites.},

While the assemblages of both platforms were dominated by rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), there were also significant differences. Compared to Gail, Eureka: (1) exhibited higher densities of all species combined and of most species in common, (2) had more mature individuals of most species, (3) exhibited greater species richness, and (4) had higher densities of species typical of complex high relief. We propose that the complex midwater jacket of Eureka, with its many sheltering sites, resembles rugose natural rocky reefs.

Questions have arisen regarding how this option would affect the nursery function of the remaining structure. Between 2008 and 2010, we surveyed the densities of YOY fishes at seven intact platforms, as well as six reefs and three shipwrecks that did not crest near the surface and thus might act as surrogates for topped platforms. Rockfishes of about five species dominated the deeper parts of the platforms, reefs, and shipwrecks, while YOY blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), were most characteristic of the shallow portions of platforms. Over the course of the study, we observed large fluctuations in the recruitment success of fishes; recruitment of rockfishes was particularly successful in 2010, while particularly poor for blacksmith in the same year. This interannual pattern was observed throughout our study sites. In general, the YOY fish assemblages around the deeper parts of the platforms were similar to those around the reefs and shipwrecks, implying that removing the shallow parts of California platform may have relatively little effect on juvenile rockfish recruitment; however, blacksmith recruitment to platforms will likely decrease. © 2012 Rosenstiel School of Marine \& Atmospheric Science of the University of Myami.},

	abstract = {Federal law governing fisheries management recognizes the role habitat plays in structuring fish assemblages and achieving sustainable fisheries. However, in most instances it is not known which aspects of habitat are important to the lives of fish species. In 2004, we examined the importance of sheltering sites (crevices) to fishes living along low ledges in deeper waters off Anacapa Island, southern California. We found that patterns of fish-habitat relationships varied among the eight most abundant species. Three species, bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis), vermilion (S. miniatus), and flag (S. rubrivinctus) rockfishes, had densities one to three orders of magnitude greater in the deep crevice habitat compared to low relief rock or shallow crevice habitats. Density and mean size of the two most abundant fishes, halfbanded (S. semicinctus) and squarespot (S. hopkinsi) rockfishes, generally increased as complexity of rock habitat increased. Not all species had the highest densities in deep crevice habitat. Greenspotted rockfish (S. chlorostictus) and blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) showed no significant difference in density among rock habitats. Pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) were absent in the deep crevice habitat and abundant only in low relief rock habitats. Our study implies that it is not sufficient to distinguish only between soft and hard bottom types when using habitat to guide fisheries management strategies. Finer-scale investigations of fish-habitat relationships, paired with habitat mapping and groundtruthing, aid in the design and positioning of Marine Park Areas (MPAs) and are necessary to facilitate understanding of how a particular MPA may contribute to fisheries management.},

From these surveys, we estimated that there was a minimum of 430,000 juvenile bocaccio at these eight structures. We determined this number to be about 20\% of the average number of juvenile bocaccio that survive annually for the geographic range of the species. When these juveniles become adults, they will contribute about one percent (0.8\%) of the additional amount of fish needed to rebuild the Pacific Coast population. By comparison, juvenile bocaccio recruitment to nearshore natural nursery grounds, as determined through regional scuba surveys, was low in the same year.

Two of the three platforms (Gail and Hidalgo) that harbored mature bocaccio had larger mature individuals than did any natural reef. Platform Gail had by far the highest densities of both mature bocaccio and cowcod of any natural or human-made habitat and the potential larval production of both species at Platform Gail was much higher than at any other site surveyed. We estimated the removal of Platform Gail would be the equivalent of removing 12.57 ha of average-producing natural habitat in southern California for cowcod or 29.24 ha of average-producing natural habitat for bocaccio. These results may have implications for the platform decommissioning process. © 2005 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

Juvenile cowcod occupied depths between 52 and 330 m and demonstrated ontogenetic shifts in their habitat associations. Small fish (5-20 cm TL) lived primarily among cobbles or cobbles and small boulders. As fish grew, they moved into high-relief rock habitats, including boulder fields and rock ridges. Small cowcods were found with pygmy, Sebastes wilsoni, and swordspine, Sebastes ensifer, rockfishes. Larger juveniles often associated with juvenile bocaccio, Sebastes paucispinis, juvenile widow rockfish, Sebastes entomelas, and squarespot rockfish, Sebastes hopkinsi.

A total of 401 dives (comprising 1,015 transects and 14,373 habitat patches) were made in waters between 19 and 365 m deep. All natural habitat types were included, although both soft sea floors and rocky reefs were surveyed more than any other type. A total of 717,526 fishes, representing a minimum of 137 species and 47 families, were observed. Rockfishes (genus Sebastes), with a minimum of 50 species and 647,495 individuals (90.2\% of all fishes observed), dominated most of the habitats. The most abundant species, squarespot (Sebastes hopkinsi), halfbanded (Sebastes semicinctus), shortbelly (Sebastes jordani), and pygmy rockfishes (Sebastes wilsoni), are dwarf taxa that either school or aggregate. The most abundant non-rockfish species was the benthic and territorial blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii). Both species richness and overall fish densities were highest in the shallowest sites. Most of the fishes in all habitats were small (≤20 cm TL long) and economically important species were generally uncommon. Forty-four species were found to be characteristic of the study area (occurring in at least 5\% of the transects) and these species formed three faunal associations centered around depths of 62, 105, and 168 m. Based on size frequency distributions, at least 18 of the characteristic species exhibited ontogenetic movements, with young-of-the-year and older juveniles living in relatively shallow waters and larger individuals generally in deeper depths. In this study, the abundance of juvenile widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas), and the virtual absence of adults, in southern California waters may demonstrate an ontogenetic northward movement of this species. This research implies that substantial harvesting of larger species by commercial and recreational fishers has helped alter some fish assemblages, allowing small and "weedy" species to thrive. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {An oil pipeline and its surrounding seafloor, located in the Santa Barbara Channel, southern California, were surveyed for fishes using a manned research sub-mersible. The parts of the pipeline and seafloor surveyed were situated in waters 95-235 m deep. Some sections of the surveyed pipe were covered with both sessile and motile invertebrates, such as sea anemones (Metridium cf. farcimen) and sea urchins (Allocentrotus fragilis), sea stars (particularly Hippasteria cf. spinosa and Stylasterias cf. forreri), basket stars (Gorgonocephalus eucnemis), spot prawns (Pandalus platyceros), and king crabs (Paralithodes californiensis). Based on differences in fish assemblages, four habitats (shallow and deep pipeline and shallow and deep seafloor) were categorized. Fish densities along the shallow portion of the pipeline were about seven times higher than on the adjacent seafloor and densities along the deep pipeline portion were nearly six times that of the deeper seafloor. Along the pipeline, rockfishes comprised 84\% of the fishes and included 22 species. Unidentified sanddabs (probably most or all Citharichthys sordidus), forming 33.2\%, and combfishes (Zaniolepis frenata and Z. latipinnis), comprising 19\% of the total, were most often observed on the seafloor. Most of the fishes living on the pipeline were either juveniles of such larger taxa as blackgill (Sebastes melanostomus), flag (S. rubrivinctus), and vermilion (S. miniatus) rockfishes, cowcod (S. levis), and lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), or diminutive species such as halfbanded (S. semicinctus) and stripetail (S. saxicola) rockfishes, combfishes (Zaniolepis spp.), and poachers (Family Agonidae). Higher densities of fishes were often noted in areas of the pipeline that had been undercut. Of particular interest were the relatively high densities of juvenile cowcod along the deeper parts of the pipeline, densities that were far higher than any seen at over 80 natural outcrops and at ten platforms.

	abstract = {Between 1995 and 2002, we surveyed fish assemblages at seven oil platforms off southern and central California using the manned research submersible Delta. At each platform, there is a large horizontal beam situated at or near the sea floor. In some instances, shells and sediment have buried this beam and in other instances it is partially or completely exposed. We found that fish species responded in various ways to the amount of exposure of the beam. A few species, such as blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii), greenstriped rockfish (Sebastes elongatus), and pink seaperch (Zalembius rosaceus) tended to avoid the beam. However, many species that typically associate with natural rocky outcrops, such as bocaccio (S. paucispinis), cowcod (S. levis), copper (S. caurinus), greenblotched (S. rosenblatti), pinkrose (S. simulator) and vermilion (S. miniatus) rockfishes, were found most often where the beam was exposed. In particular, a group of species (e.g., bocaccio, cowcod, blue (Sebastes mystinus), and vermilion rockfishes) called here the "sheltering habitat" guild, lived primarily where the beam was exposed and formed a crevice. This work demonstrates that the presence of sheltering sites is important in determining the species composition of man-made reefs and, likely, natural reefs. This research also indicates that adding structures that form sheltering sites in and around decommissioned platforms will likely lead to higher densities of many species typical of hard and complex structure.},

Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range¼5–15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs},

Sympatric subclasses emerge when there are closely interacting subgroups occupying a very similar niche, but whose ecology dictates distinct mortality rates. Examples include multispecies complexes of juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in the California current and juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in streams following different life history strategies. I derive an MSRF and apply it to the ecology of larval and juvenile rockfish with maternal effects. In several species of rockfish, older mothers produce superior larvae. This is called a maternal effect. For these species, larval and juvenile cohorts comprise several sympatric subclasses, each with a distinct mortality rate related to the age of their mothers. I apply this model to data for black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) in California and Oregon and find the recruitment estimates based on data from a declining population may overestimate productivity of a recovering population if maternal effects are neglected. The MSRF proves to be a flexible framework for studying recruitment in the presence of sympatric subclasses.},

A constant-harvest-rate policy may work for long-lived fishes (those with life spans comparable to or exceeding the duration of adverse conditions). Exploitation of short-lived fishes (species with life spans shorter than the duration of adverse conditions) benefits from policies that link harvest rate to environmental conditions, but a delayed response can be desirable. Therefore, rapid identification of regime shifts is not necessary but could provide advance notice of long-term changes in expected harvests. Planning horizons, especially for stock rebuilding, may have to be much longer than has been typical, even a century or more, During adverse periods little rebuilding may occur even after total cessation of fishing. Adverse species interactions like intraguild competition or 'cultivation effects' may prolong rebuilding or reduce sustainable yields. Management reference points like Fmsy and Bmsy can be strongly influenced by abundance of competitors. Importantly, Bmsy of large predators may be well above half the unfished biomass if their removal releases smaller competitors. Although adverse interactions may be reversible, rebuilding of apex predators may require decades to centuries.},

	abstract = {A capacity for matrotrophic viviparity was established in the yellowtail rockfish Sebastes flavidus (Teleostei: Scorpaeniformes). The incorporation of radiolabel into embryos from [14C]phosphatidylcholine present in the maternal serum during gestation provided the first in vivo demonstration of matrotrophy of phospholipid for any viviparous teleost and of any nutrient for a member of the genus Sebastes. Radiolabel content increased as embryos progressed through ontogeny. Serum proteins of 170 kDa, present in vitellogenic and embryogenic females, but not in earlier stages, in immature females or in males, indicated the presence of vitellogenin in pregnant females and, thus, the potential for matrotrophic supplementation to yolk sequestered before fertilization. The retention of higher molecular mass proteins and highly phosphorylated proteins and the maintenance of total protein content in yolk during early to mid embryogenesis argue for exogenous maternal supply during gestation. As ovarian development proceeded from the oocyte through successive embryonic stages, the distribution of yolk proteins shifted from higher (67\&shy;97 kDa) to lower molecular masses ({\textless}70 kDa). The results of these experimental studies corroborate data from field investigations showing that yellowtail rockfish can matrotrophically supplement embryo nutrients obtained before fertilization. Thus, yellowtail rockfish represent a teleost species positioned within the viviparity continuum and not at its extremes.},

The rockfish genus Sebastes is speciose ({\textgreater}100 spp.), morphologically and ecologically diverse and many species are heavily fished. We used a complete Sebastes phylogeny to calculate a measure of evolutionary isolation for each species and compared this to their morphology and imperilment. We found that evolutionarily isolated species in the northeast Pacific are both larger-bodied and, independent of body size, morphologically more distinctive. We examined extinction risk within rockfish using a compound measure of each species' intrinsic vulnerability to overfishing and categorizing species as commercially fished or not. Evolutionarily isolated species in the northeast Pacific are more likely to be fished, and, due to their larger sizes and to life history traits such as long lifespan and slow maturation rate, they are also intrinsically more vulnerable to overfishing. Finally, the set of northeast Pacific species that are both fished and most intrinsically vulnerable to fishing are among the most evolutionarily distinctive. These findings suggest that, at least for this clade, extra attention should be paid to evolutionary distinctiveness when prioritizing species for conservation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Sea otters are a classic example of a predator controlling ecosystem productivity through cascading effects on basal, habitat-forming kelp species. However, their indirect effects on other kelp-associated taxa like fishes are poorly understood. We examined the effects of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) reintroduction along the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) distributions and the trophic niches and growth of two common kelp forest fishes, black (Sebastes melanops) and copper (S. caurinus) rockfishes. We sampled 47 kelp forests, and found that red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) were eliminated in the presence of otters, and that kelp forests were 3.7 times deeper and 18.8 times larger. Despite order-of-magnitude differences in kelp forest size, adult black and copper rockfishes contained less kelp-derived carbon in their tissues (as measured by stable isotopes of C and N) in regions with otters. Adults of both species had higher mean trophic positions in the presence of otters, indicating more frequent consumption of higher trophic level prey such as fishes. Smaller trophic niche space of rockfishes in the presence of otters indicated a higher degree of trophic specialization. Juvenile black rockfishes rapidly shifted to higher kelp-carbon contents, trophic positions, and body condition factors after settling in kelp forests. The relationships of growth to length, percentage of kelp carbon, and trophic position varied between the two regions, indicating that potential effects of kelp forest size on trophic ontogeny may also affect individual performance. Our results provide evidence that the indirect effects of otters on rockfishes arise largely through the creation of habitat for fishes and other prey rather than a direct trophic connection through invertebrates or other consumers of kelp productivity.},

We investigated the relationship between coastal upwelling and early life history of black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), a midwater aggregating species, and CQB rockfishes (a solitary benthic species complex including Sebastes caurinus, Sebastes maliger, and Sebastes auriculatus), between two oceanographically distinct years on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. We analysed otolith microstructure to determine parturition and settlement dates, pelagic durations, and preand postsettlement growth rates. High CQB rockfish recruitment in 2005 was associated with prolonged downwelling and warm ocean temperatures, late parturition dates, fast presettlement growth, short pelagic durations, and small size-at-settlement. In contrast, high black rockfish recruitment in 2006 was associated with strong upwelling and cool ocean temperatures, slow presettlement growth, and protracted pelagic durations. Presettlement growth of both rockfish complexes increased with high sea surface temperature, but was unrelated to chlorophyll a concentration. Our results indicate that the same oceanographic conditions give rise to fast presettlement growth and short pelagic durations for both groups, but that different factors lead to strong recruitment in each.},

	abstract = {In the Strait of Georgia and Howe Sound, British Columbia, colonies of individual cloud sponges, growing on rock (known as sponge gardens) receive resource subsidies from the high biodiversity of epifauna on adjacent rock habitats. Bioherms are reefs of glass sponges living on layers of dead sponges. In the same area as the sponge gardens, newly discovered bioherms in Howe Sound, BC (49. 34. 67 N, 123.16.26 W) at depths of 28- to 35-m are constructed exclusively by Aphrocallistes vastus, the cloud sponge. The sponge gardens had much higher taxon richness than the bioherms. The sponge garden had 106 species from 10 phyla, whereas the bioherm had only 15 species from 5 phyla. For recruiting juvenile rockfish (quillback, Sebastes maliger), the food subsidy of sponge gardens appears to be missing on bioherms of cloud sponge, where biodiversity is relatively low. While adult and subadult rockfishes (S. maliger, S. ruberrimus, S. proriger, and S. elongatus) were present on bioherms, no evidence for nursery recruitment of inshore rockfishes to bioherms was observed, whereas the sponge gardens supported high densities of newly recruited S. maliger, perhaps owing to the combination of both refuge and feeding opportunities. These results indicate that sponge gardens form a habitat for early stages of inshore S. maliger, whereas A. vastus bioherms are associated only with older juvenile and adult rockfishes. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

The species composition of commercial passenger fishing vessel catches from 1959 to 1994 varied with changes in fishing location and depth. The shift from shallow nearshore locations to deeper offshore locations in the late 1970's and 1980's changed the emphasis from the blue rock-fish, S. mystinus, of shallow waters to the deeper, commercially fished chilipepper, S. goodei, and bocaccio, S. paucispinis. The mean size of rockfish in the catch increased as the latter species were targeted at greater depths but then declined as stocks of older fish disappeared by the mid 1980's. During 1960-94 the mean size of all ten leading species in the recreational catch declined. The declines ranged from 1\% for canary rockfish, S. pinniger, to 27\% for chilipepper. The sizes of the deeper living species declined more than those of shallower species. The low frequency of strong recruitment events and increase in fishing mortality and natural mortality appear to have contributed to the declining mean size. The scarcity of older fish, observed as a drop in mean size to below the size of maturity for 50\% of females, leads to concern for future recruitment of the larger species, especially bocaccio, chilipepper, yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, and canary rockfish.},

In Canada, at-risk marine fishes denied listing under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) are meant to receive comparable measures under the Fisheries Act.

Overall, at-risk marine fishes typically spend 3.25 years under consideration for SARA, during which time they receive no additional protection. Endangered and Threatened marine fishes (i.e., those most at risk) face the greatest bias and receive the least protection; their SARA decisions are typically delayed, with almost 5 years usually passing between their COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) assessment and listing decision; most (70.6\%) are then denied listing, after which the Fisheries Act provides few of the SARA-required measures. For SARA-listed marine fishes, recovery strategies are usually late and to date no action plans have been produced. Marine fish conservation is hindered by SARA’s slow pace, incomplete recovery measures, and inadequate implementation of the Fisheries Act.

We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9\% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50\% or less of the CPUE at MSY.

	abstract = {Some fish stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while fishing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment configurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of fishery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting fishery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.},

	abstract = {For many fish taxa, trophic position and relative fecundity increase with body size, yet fisheries remove the largest individuals, altering food webs and reducing population productivity. Marine reserves and other forms of spatial protection can help mitigate this problem, but the effectiveness of these management tools may vary interspecifically and spatially. Using visual survey data collected on the Central Coast of British Columbia, for 12 species of exploited rockfish we found that body size responses to spatial fishery closures depended on interspecific variation in growth parameter k (the rate at which the asymptotic body size is approached) and on location. For two closures, relative body sizes were larger at protected than at adjacent fished sites, and these differences were greater for species with lower k values. Reduced fishery mortality likely drove these results, as an unfished species did not respond to spatial protection. For three closures, however, body sizes did not differ between protected and adjacent fished sites, and for another closure species with higher k values were larger at fished than at protected sites while species with lower k values had similar sizes in both treatments. Variation in the age of closures is unlikely to have influenced results, as most data were collected when closures were 13 to 15-years-old. Rather, the lack of larger fish inside four of six spatial fishery closures potentially reflects a combination of smaller size of the area protected, poor fisher compliance, and lower oceanographic productivity. Interspecific differences in movement behavior did not affect body size responses to spatial protection. To improve understanding, additional research should be conducted at deeper depths encompassing the distribution of older, larger fish. Our study-which was conceptualized and executed by an alliance of Indigenous peoples seeking to restore rockfishes-illustrates how life history and behavioral theory provide a useful lens for framing and interpreting species differences in responses to spatial protection.},

	title = {Prioritizing fish stock assessments},
	abstract = {Fish stock assessments provide the quantitative scientific information required by resource managers to determine stock status and set annual catch limits to prevent overfishing (Mace et al. 2001). Thus, assessments for managed fish and shellfish stocks represent an important core activity of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Well-established procedures for these assessments have been developed to utilize data from fishery catch monitoring, fishery-independent surveys of abundance, biological studies, and other sources to produce the highly focused deliverables required by the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA). These data collection and analysis activities constitute a significant portion of the NMFS budget, but resources are insufficient to assess all managed stocks each year (nor is this a realistic target). It is therefore important to provide a transparent, quantitative, and objective process for determining what appropriate assessment targets are, and how to best meet those targets by determining priorities for assessment. This document describes a national framework for prioritization of stock assessments. Although fish stock assessment prioritization will take place under the direction of this national framework, the process will be implemented on a regional1 level coordinating with existing regional processes and planning bodies. The process is not intended to reallocate resources between regions; instead, the focus is on ensuring efficient and transparent decision-making related to stock assessment planning within each region. Prioritization results are considered to be advisory and non-binding, allowing regions to maintain the flexibility to make departures from recommendations when necessary. However, results will have significant visibility and departures should be used judiciously and with adequate justification. Stock assessment prioritization includes first-time assessments for previously unassessed stocks, updating existing assessments using established methods/data, and upgrading assessments to use new types of data/methods. All stocks managed under Federal Fishery Management Plans, as well as additional stocks that may be assessed using NMFS Science Center resources, may be included in assessment prioritization. For stocks that have been previously assessed, the prioritization approach sets targets for assessment completeness (level) and frequency and then determines priorities relative to meeting those targets. For previously unassessed stocks, the system provides an opportunity to periodically examine their fishery importance, ecosystem importance, biological vulnerability to overfishing, preliminary information on fishery impact level (stock status), and data availability to determine which stocks are both sufficiently at risk to warrant an assessment and have sufficient data to conduct at least a data-limited assessment.},

Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

The unique architecture of each platform may influence the size and structure of the associated fish assemblage if different structural elements form distinct habitats for fishes. Using scuba survey data from 11 southern California platforms from 1995 to 2000, we examined fish assemblages associated with structural elements of the structure, including the major horizontal crossbeams outside of the jacket, vertical jacket legs, and horizontal crossbeams that span the jacket interior. Patterns of habitat association were examined among three depth zones: shallow ({\textless}16.8 m), midwater (16.8- 26 m), and deep ({\textgreater}26 m); and between two life stages: youngof- the-year and non-young-of-the-year. Fish densities tended to be greatest along horizontal beams spanning the jacket interior, relative to either horizontal or vertical beams along the jacket exterior, indicating that the position of the habitat within the overall structure is an important characteristic affecting fish habitat use. Fish densities were also higher in transects centered directly over a vertical or horizontal beam relative to transects that did not contain a structural element. These results contribute to the understanding of fish habitat use on existing artificial reefs, and can inform platform decommissioning decisions as well as the design of new offshore structures intended to increase fish production.},

Platform jackets, conductors, and shell mounds often host a diverse and productive marine community, and among the myriad considerations associated with decommissioning planning, platform operators and federal and state regulatory agencies will consider the ecological value of existing underwater structures as artificial reefs. In the event of partial removal of platform structure, fish assemblages on decommissioned platforms may remain unchanged in areas where structure is left intact. However, on the seafloor beneath the platforms, a mound of debris often called the shell mound will likely change over time if the supply of falling mussels and other organisms from the productive surface part of the structure is removed. In this study, we review shell mound research relevant to decommissioning, including mound formation, contaminant loads, associated biological communities, and transitions following the removal of platform structures at four sites. To address the gap in knowledge of shell mound fish community structure, we used manned submersible and remotely operated vehicle surveys from 1997 to 2013 to estimate the biomass, density, species composition and similarity between shell mounds at 22 southern California platforms. We found a wide range of variability in fish density and shell mound areal extent. Species composition also varied among sites, with three significant community clusters primarily distinguished by species depth preferences.

NMFS received a draft status review document from Scripps, in April 1090. In order to obtain an independent peer-revit.:w, NMFS requested three non-federal scientists to review and report on the scientific merits of this status review. By August 1999, NMFS received these anonymous reviews. Abalone experts from the California Department of Fish and Game and the National Park Service. and NMFS scientists, also reviewed the document. Subsequently, the authors incorporated these comments into this status review, and submitted the revised final status rcvicw document to NMFS on March 20, 2000.},

The bulk catchability (Q), defined to be the ratio between swept-area biomass and actual biomass, is herein modeled using a Bayesian age-structured meta-analysis of suitable West Coast rockfish stocks. Six shelf stocks of rockfish were used. The posterior distribution of Q was insensitive to choice of prior and gives a probability of about 0.05 that the bulk catchability of a randomly selected shelf rockfish species will be unity or higher. Between survey variability in bulk catchabilities was modeled as a multiplicative main effect. With individual posterior probabilities in excess of 0.99, bulk catchabilities were lower than normal in 1977 and 1980 and higher than normal in 1989 and 1998. The low catchabilities in 1977 and 1980 are consistent with previously identified problems with lack of bottom contact in the earlier years of the survey. Future work will extend the model to incorporate dynamic modeling of unassessed rockfish stocks, and suggestions for this are given.},

Hence, these derivatives can be readily estimated from a posterior sample and the calculation is shown to be especially straightforward for parameters having a marginal prior that is of exponential family form. Three examples are given. The first fits a Ricker curve to stock-recruit data and, for several important management parameters, examines the sensitivity of the Bayes estimates to the informative log-normal priors placed on the maximum annual reproductive rate and density-dependent compensation parameters. Using the WinBUGS software, it is demonstrated that these derivatives can easily be estimated by a minor addition to the program code. The utility of the estimated sensitivities is examined by refitting the Ricker model using a range of different priors. The second example revisits a hierarchical model that was used to perform a meta-stock assessment on several US West Coast rockfish (Sebastes spp.) stocks, and examines the sensitivity of the Bayes estimate of bulk catchability to the hyper-prior. The final example looks at an example from the literature and uses summary statistics provided therein to determine the sensitivity of model parameters to their prior means. © 2005 NRC.},

Responses to higher-frequency climate change (interannual El Nin̄o and La Niña events) were strong, with declines in rockfish take in warm-water years. Responses to low-frequency climate events (e.g. shifts of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO) were less obvious. Inter-annual patterns showed no response to the 1976-1977 regime shift to warmer PDO conditions. Instead, rockfish use declined beginning in 1989, corresponding to another suggested regime change, then rebounded shortly after the hypothesized return to a cool phase of the PDO in the late 1990s. Infra-annual diet patterns, however, revealed changes in rockfish use well before 1989. These signals indicate that declines may have corresponded to the 1976-1977 regime shift but were lagged, possibly due to the long lifespan and intermittent recruitment of rockfish. This interpretation is supported by local upwelling patterns that show a lagged correlation between upwelling and juvenile rockfish abundance in the marine bird diet.},

The replicated experiment design consisted of two water temperatures (7·4 and 13·0° C) and four water concentrations of Ba:Ca and Mn:Ca. A positive, linear relationship between [Ba:Ca]water and [Ba:Ca]otolith was observed at both temperatures. A positive temperature effect was also observed with mean partition coefficients for Ba (DBa) greater in the 13° C than in the 7·4° C treatments (mean = 0·061 and 0·048, respectively). There was no relationship between [Mn:Ca]water and [Mn:Ca]otolith although a negative temperature effect was observed. Mean partition coefficients for Mn (DMn) were lower in the 13° C than in the 7·4° C treatments (mean = 0·027 and 0·036, respectively). The data presented support the assumption of a positive, linear relationship between water and otolith Metal:Ca concentrations for Ba:Ca but not for Mn:Ca. Thus, although indicative of residence in distinct water masses, observed variation in [Metal:Ca]otolith may not reflect variation in water concentration and can be affected by temperature. Caution should be applied in the interpretation of geographic variation of [Mn:Ca]otolith until the mechanisms regulating its incorporation are more fully understood. © 2009 The Author.

We tested this assumption by comparing otolith microchemistry and microsatellite DNA of adult black rockfish from four locations in Oregon and Washington. We observed significant differences among locations in element-to-Ca ratios (Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Zn:Ca, Sr:Ca, and Ba:Ca) at the otolith edge, which represented the last year of life. Discriminant function analysis, based on otolith element-to-Ca ratios classified, on average, 64\% of the fish to collection location, suggesting that the majority of individuals from these locations did not mix. Using microsatellite DNA, we observed significant genetic differences among adults collected 340-460 km apart (FST = 0.018 ± 0.004). Using five and seven loci, 63\% and 75\% of the fish, respectively, were correctly assigned to collection location.

We combined otolith microstructure and microchemistry of black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) to assess their potential to provide relative estimates of larval dispersal distance. In 2001 and 2002 we measured trace elements at discrete otolith regions, representing the (i) egg/early-larval, (ii) pelagic larval, and (iii) late-larval/early-juvenile periods of fish collected at three locations 120-460 km apart. Discriminant-function analyses based on geochemical signatures at each otolith region accurately grouped an average of 85\% (jackknife = 67\%) and 87\% (jackknife = 81\%) of the fish to collection location in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Age at collection ranged from 83 to 174 days and parturition dates within each site were spread over a 22- to 66-day period. Therefore, individuals within sites were not released at similar times. A probable explanation of these data is that larvae from different geographic locations did not mix during ontogeny and possibly did not disperse long distances alongshore. Larval dispersal distances may be appreciably shorter, {\textless}120 km, than previously assumed based on models of passive dispersal.},

	abstract = {During the past century, commercial fisheries have expanded from small vessels fishing in shallow, coastal habitats to a broad suite of vessels and gears that fish virtually every marine habitat on the globe. Understanding how fisheries have developed in space and time is critical for interpreting and managing the response of ecosystems to the effects of fishing, however time series of spatially explicit data are typically rare. Recently, the 1933-1968 portion of the commercial catch dataset from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife was recovered and digitized, completing the full historical series for both commercial and recreational datasets from 1933-2010. These unique datasets include landing estimates at a coarse 10 by 10 minute "grid-block" spatial resolution and extends the entire length of coastal California up to 180 kilometers from shore. In this study, we focus on the catch history of groundfish which were mapped for each grid-block using the year at 50\% cumulative catch and total historical catch per habitat area. We then constructed generalized linear models to quantify the relationship between spatiotemporal trends in groundfish catches, distance from ports, depth, percentage of days with wind speed over 15 knots, SST and ocean productivity. Our results indicate that over the history of these fisheries, catches have taken place in increasingly deeper habitat, at a greater distance from ports, and in increasingly inclement weather conditions. Understanding spatial development of groundfish fisheries and catches in California are critical for improving population models and for evaluating whether implicit stock assessment model assumptions of relative homogeneity of fisheries removals over time and space are reasonable. This newly reconstructed catch dataset and analysis provides a comprehensive appreciation for the development of groundfish fisheries with respect to commonly assumed trends of global fisheries patterns that are typically constrained by a lack of long-term spatial datasets.},

As one proxy for ecosystem services and benefits, we quantified and mapped catch and economic value of California commercial fisheries removals using a 75-year spatially explicit time series. From 1931 to 2005, approximately 88\% of the catch was attributed to finfish. However, there has been an increasing reliance of proportional value from invertebrates over the last 25 years. The spatial organization of historical catches suggests species composition varies substantially by depth and latitude, and an evaluation of changes in the spatial distribution of catches in three different time periods suggests that spatial shifts in catch locations have occurred for some taxonomic groups over time. A spatial assessment of historical catches and value benefits marine spatial planning, informs stock assessments, provides a quantification of ecosystem services, and facilitates ecosystem-based approaches to marine fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Diets of top predators may be useful indicators to the availability of forage fish in marine ecosystems. Juvenile rockfish (young-of-the-year Sebastes spp.) compose a significant part of the diet for many predators in the central California Current, including chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and several species of marine birds and mammals. Herein, we develop annual indices of juvenile rockfish relative abundance by collating time series data sets on: (i) the proportion of rockfish in the diet of three species of seabirds breeding on Southeast Farallon Island (1975-2002); (ii) the number of rockfish in chinook salmon stomachs (1980-99); and (iii) the abundance of rockfish captured in scientific mid-water trawl net surveys (1983-2002). We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine indices, and refer to these as 'Multivariate Rockfish Indices' (MRI). Combining time series verifies the patterns shown by each alone and provides a synoptic perspective on juvenile rockfish relative abundance. The diets of predators with the largest foraging ranges (Common Murre, Uria aalge) and chinook salmon co-varied strongly with the net samples, and appear to be the best indicators. The salmon also sampled species of Sebastes not caught in the nets. The MRI reveals interannual variability in juvenile rockfish abundance, a substantial decline in abundance in the 1990s, and a partial recovery in the early 2000s. Predator-based sampling is a cost-effective enhancement of scientific net sampling. © 2007 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Present catches of traditional marine resources are characterized by a great predominance of pelagic species, especially among the fishes. Since World War II the catch of pelagic fishes has increased by 27.5 million metric tons (mmt) and now constitutes about 70\% of the total; production of demersal species has increased by 10.5 mmt. Over 60\% of the catch is of plankton-feeding organisms, a little over 25\% is predacious fishes, and only 4\% bottom feeders.Of the world catch of aquatic organisms in 1970, 63.4 mmt (90\%) was fish, 5.2 mmt invertebrates, about 1 mmt whales, and 0.7 mmt seaweeds. About 90\% of this catch was from the ocean. From 1950 to 1970 marine catches rose from 16.1 to 55.8 mmt, while those from fresh waters increased from 2.4 to 7.6 mmt.About 70\% of marine catches are made up of seven families of fishes, with the Engraulidae having by far the leading role — about 24\%. Next in order come Clupeidae and Gadidae. Pleuronectidae, Scorpaenidae, Sparidae, etc. are less important. Only 5.06 million tons (8\%) of the catch is of invertebrates. Of these 65–70\% are molluscs (mostly squids), 30\% crustaceans, and 1\% echinoderms.Species such as cod, redfish, rockfish, flounders and clupeids in most areas of the northern hemisphere have reached or almost reached their limit. The greatest increase in demersal catches can be expected from the Falkland–Patagonia area, where landings of hake, poutassou, grenadier, and some other species could reach 3 million tons, and in New Zealand and Australian waters the take may rise to 4 or 5 mmt. Pelagic fishes may eventually yield catches of the order of 17–20 mmt, including sardines, anchovies, mackerels, carangids, sauries, smaller tunas, myctophids, and squids. In all, a future catch of 52 mmt of pelagic species and 30 mmt of demersal species may be possible.In addition, perhaps 1 mmt can be expected from fishing in depths of 800–1200 m for macrurids, rockfsishes, halibuts, etc. The yield of demersal invertebrates may reach 2.2 mmt, anything more would require extensive aquaculture.A total potential catch of 90 mmt of familiar species is estimated — not including krill, other zooplankton, or seaweed. This figure implies adequate and effective conservation regulations, without which catches can be expected to decline rather than increase.},

These stages are most frequently distributed in either midwater or near-surface habitats; this dichotomy may require different strategies for successful recruitment. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The authors examined how such LAA data can lead to erroneous conclusions about individual growth, and whether asymptotic growth can give rise to such data. They considered two hypotheses: 1) that a time trend in growth rate resulted in larger fish in more recent years and 2) that there are multiple growth types, where growth and mortality rates are directly related. Both hypotheses can generate data identical to those for the rockfish. A single set of LAA data is inadequate for describing individual growth, but if sufficient data are available, model ambiguity can be resolved and reasonable parameter estimates obtained.

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However, these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems, which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling methods on simulated from a wide range of ecological scenarios. We expect that these models will extend the range of ecological systems to which nonlinear forecasting methods can be usefully applied.},

Sebastes carnatus and Sebastes chrysomelas are a sympatrically distributed pair of sister species having no morphologically distinguishing characteristics other than color: S. carnatus has pinkish spots on a brown background, and S. chrysomelas has yellow spots on a black background. In this study, seven nuclear microsatellite DNA loci were employed to assess relatedness of 111 S. carnatus and 91 S. chrysomelas sampled from three locations spanning the species' range. Analysis of the seven microsatellite loci provided evidence of genetic divergence between color morphs (FST = 0.046, P {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, magnitude of genetic divergence between the color morphs was consistent among geographic locations.

During the summer of 1991, I observed major fluctuations in YOY kelp rockfish abundance in the canopy before the onset of a vertical migration downward to the Macrocystis holdfasts. Within the Macrocystis canopy, YOY kelp rockfish make a series of microhabitat shifts preparatory to their downward migration, forming smaller and more closely held aggregations. Experimental manipulations of Macrocystis architecture indicate that YOY kelp rockfish densities are reduced in areas with only small Macrocystis (few stipes) compared to unmanipulated areas with a range of Macrocystis sizes. Unusually large Macrocystis, created by binding multiple kelps together, did not compensate for a preponderance of small Macrocystis in the surrounding areas. In unmanipulated habitat, YOY kelp rockfish densities were correlated with the size of the Macrocystis (number of stipes). Habitat selection in the canopy and holdfasts appears to be behavioral and is closely tied to the architecture of the alga. The onset of the downward migration appears to be triggered by a combination of ontogenetic and environmental cues. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Altogether. 1,060 fish captured by commercial groundfish and shrimp trawlers between July 1986 and July 1987 were examined. Reproductive events were protracted. Insemination of females occurred from August to December, and fertilization and parturition followed from December through March. Spermatozoa were observed within both vitellogenic and previtellogenic ovaries between July and November. Reproductive events in smaller males and females were delayed relative to those in larger individuals. Females attained 50\% maturity at a greater size (36.5 cm total length) and age (8.4 years) than males (29.6 cm total length; 5.1 years). The unimodal development of eggs and larvae indicated one parturition per year. Most age-6, age-7, and age-8 females possessed ovaries in an intermediate “maturing” condition. Histological analysis revealed that most of these females were immature: ovaries showed no evidence of previous spawning, oocytes never developed beyond an early vitellogenic stage, and during months of parturition, many of these females were resorbing their advancing oocytes. Total fecundities ranged from 19,815 to 489.064 oocytes per ovary pair and increased exponentially with increasing fish length, linearly with fish weight, and asymptotically with fish age (6 to 66 years). © 1994 by the American Fisheries Society.},

	abstract = {A diverse assemblage of adult reef fishes and invertebrates occurs at offshore oil production platforms in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Coincident with the initiation of the decommissioning of six platforms in the SCB, the goal of this study was to examine how a platform's geographical location plays a role in its potential contribution of larval recruits to natural areas. Using a three-dimensional biophysical model, we quantified the potential connectivity of larvae, particularly relevant to reef fishes, from three offshore platforms to four coastal shelf regions where the majority of rocky settlement habitat occurs in the SCB. The regions cover the shelves of the mainland coast and islands and offshore banks in the southern SCB. The main findings indicate that (1) the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the southern SCB to populations in the northern SCB are greater than the potential for larval subsidies from platforms in the northern SCB to the southern SCB; (2) there is greater seasonal variability of potential connectivity from platforms to the mainland shelf region of the northern SCB than to the mainland shelf region of the southern SCB or shelves around islands and banks; and (3) there is consistency across years in the relative magnitude of potential connectivity from the platforms to the four shelf regions. We conclude that a platform's function as a larval source should be considered an ecological criterion when evaluating whether a platform is to be converted to an artificial reef and implementing marine spatial planning.},

In June 1998, sampling revealed high concentrations of fishes in the center of a cyclonic eddy in the western Channel corresponding to the lowest dynamic height in the study area. In contrast, eddy circulation was not consistent during the second survey in June 1999, and high concentrations of fishes were not observed. Patterns of evolving surface currents, observed by high frequency radar and concurrent CTD sampling during the trawling surveys, suggest that interannual variability in fish abundance within the Santa Barbara Channel resulted from local retention in 1998, but not in 1999. Time series of relative vorticity (a measure of eddy rotation) computed from surface current fields indicates that the cyclonic eddy observed during the 1998 survey was a stable, persistent feature developing about 6 wk before the trawling surveys. We speculate that the closed circulation of the eddy in 1998 retained larval and juvenile fishes from about late April until late June. In 1999, trains of smaller eddies propagated across the region beginning in mid-May, lasting through the survey period. Given their size and circulation strength, the propagating eddies probably disrupted the closed circulation in the western Channel. These observations indicate a strong link between coastal mesoscale flows and spatial abundance patterns of juvenile and late-stage larval fishes.},

Juvenile fishes comprised 52.8\% (16,952 of 23 species) of all individuals (32,080 juveniles and adults of 35 species) observed during scuba surveys conducted about twice per week at two platforms in the eastern Santa Barbara Channel from May to August 2004. Blacksmith, Chromis punctipinnis (Cooper, 1863), and rockfishes (genus Sebastes, at least 18 taxa) comprised 95.1\% of the recruits. Almost all rockfishes recruited to the deepest part of the platforms surveyed (26 and 31 m), while most blacksmith recruited in shallower waters. The onset of the recruitment season for juvenile rockfishes (genus Sebastes, Scorpaenidae) coincided with the advection of a low salinity water mass into the channel from the Southern California Bight. Before arrival of this water mass, water at the platforms resembled upwelled, high salinity water around the Point Conception region at the western channel entrance. Settlement pulses of rockfishes and blacksmith were observed during advective events when salinity decreased in the upper 40 m and currents turned northwestward or intensified in that direction. Two abundant rockfish species [bocaccio, Sebastes paucispinis Ayres, 1854, and treefish, Sebastes serriceps (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880)] showed synchronous patterns of juvenile settlement between platforms separated by 7 km. Our findings indicate that currents from the bight, rather than from central California, supplied recruits to settlement habitat in the eastern channel and that the spatial scale of connectivity for some fish populations in this region is greater than the channel itself.},

However, larvae from young spawners can experience higher mortality rates than larvae of older spawners, reducing the effect of egg production by young females (hereafter, maternal age effects). This reduction leads to an error in LEP that can be accounted for by reducing the fishing mortality rate, but raises the question of the magnitude of these errors if they are present but not accounted for. Calculations using parameters from a typical long-lived fish demonstrated that maternal age effects resulted in large errors in estimates of lifetime reproduction when there was a large contrast in the larval mortality rate extending over the reproductive life span. Errors were small when maternal age effects reduced the reproductive potential of only the very youngest spawners, at ages when a small fraction of females are mature. A specific example using the empirically derived maternal age effect for black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) indicated that errors in traditional management would be small for this species. © 2006 NRC.},

Banning discarding (whether under a TAC or IVQ) created the biggest increase in profit regardless of species overlap as it moves the target species biomass toward Bmey. MPAs reduced the profit in most cases and were not always successful at conserving the unproductive stock above a target size. The IVQ system managed to MEY produced the most profit among all scenarios while preserving the populations above some target values in most cases, but an IVQ system managed to MSY produced lower profits than a competitive TAC with a discard ban at some levels of species overlap.},

The presence of closed areas generally introduced a bias in the derived index of abundance, and the magnitude of bias increased as the portion of the population in closed areas increased. In general, restricting the data to the areas that have been continuously fished over time performed best when spatial closures protected a small to medium portion of the population. However, as the portion of the population that was protected increased, the time series bias associated with this approach increased, and the use of an imputation approach was needed for adequate performance.

Fourteen microsatellite loci were used to characterize geographic structure and connectivity of POP collections (1999-2005) sampled along the continental shelf break from Dixon Entrance to the Bering Sea. Despite opportunities for dispersal, there was significant, geographically related genetic structure (FST = 0.0123, P {\textless} 10-5). Adults appear to belong to neighborhoods at geographic scales less than 400 km, and possibly as small as 70 km, which indicates limited dispersal throughout their lives. The population structure observed has a finer geographic scale than current management, which suggests that measures for POP fisheries conservation should be revisited. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	title = {The biology and assessment of rockfishes in puget sound},
	abstract = {This technical review supports and is a source document for the Puget Sound Rockfish Conservation Plan. It summarizes the current knowledge of rockfish biology in Puget Sound (life history, habitat usage, and ecosystem linkages), provides an overview of the exploitation history of rockfishes, and examines their current stock status. The review also includes a series of recommendations to improve the understanding and management of rockfishes in Puget Sound. Puget Sound includes all the inland marine waters of Washington including the U.S. portions of the Straits of Juan de Fuca and Georgia, the San Juan Islands, Puget Sound proper, and Hood Canal. Rockfishes are bottomfishes managed under the auspices of the Puget Sound Groundfish Management Plan and are co-managed with the Treaty Tribes of Washington. The present management plan by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife implements a precautionary policy for groundfish management. However, previous management efforts have ranged from targeting recreational and commercial fisheries on rockfish to passive management. As rockfish stocks declined during the past three decades, the Department has progressively restricted the harvest opportunities for rockfish by eliminating targeted commercial fisheries, reducing recreational bag limits, and discouraging or eliminating recreational fisheries targeting rockfish in Puget Sound. Rockfishes in Puget Sound are a diverse group that form mixed species assemblages and require species- specific habitats at different life-stages. Rockfish have evolved to complex life strategies adapted for long survival, slow growth, late age-at-maturity, low natural mortality rates, and high habitat fidelity. Reproduction follows a pattern of irregular successful recruitment events. Population structure is highly dependent upon the evolutionary and ecological patterns of each species. Copper, quillback, and brown rockfishes living south of Port Townsend form a unique population separate from northern waters. Rockfishes feed on a wide variety of prey, including plankton, crustaceans, and fishes. Rockfishes are prey for a variety of predators including lingcod and other marine fishes, marine mammals, and marine birds. Rockfishes are very susceptible to barotrauma or being captured and brought to the surface from depth. The complex oceanography and benthic topography of Puget Sound influences rockfish distributions and population characteristics at all life-stages. Most adult rockfish are associated with high-relief, rocky habitats, but larval and juvenile stages of some rockfishes make use of open water and nearshore habitats as they grow. Nearshore vegetated habitats are particularly important for common species of rockfish and serve as nursery areas for juveniles and later provide connecting pathways for movement to adult habitats. A system of marine reserves in Puget Sound provides rockfishes with protection from harvest and provides a baseline for ecological and natural demographic information for stock assessment and conservation. Rockfish have been harvested by Native Americans and commercial and recreational fishers in Puget Sound. Rockfish harvests prior to 1970 were small relative to those between the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s when both recreational and commercial fishing effort increased. In 1974, a federal court decision reallocated salmon harvest on an equitable basis between tribal and non-tribal harvesters. Bottomfish and their fisheries were popularized for their sport, value, and healthful benefits, and previous non-tribal effort shifted to fishing for bottomfish. Since 1995, tribal fishers can harvest up to 50\% of the rockfish quota. However, tribal harvests have accounted for an average 1\% the total rockfish harvest since 1991. Regulations enacted during the past decade to conserve rockfishes reduced recent harvests by 90\%. The present status of rockfishes in Puget Sound was characterized using fishery landings trends, surveys, and species composition trends to evaluate rockfish stocks’ vulnerability to extinction. These evaluations rely upon fishery-dependent and independent information to detect changes over time. Conventional age- structure population models or biomass dynamic models were not applied due the lack of long-term catch data and associated biological information. The American Fisheries Society’s Criteria for Marine Fish Stocks were modified as a robust approach to establish stock status. These criteria are based upon life history parameters relating to population productivity and compare the magnitude of stock trends over ecologically appropriate time scales. Four status categories were based upon the magnitudes of trends and included Healthy, Precautionary, Vulnerable, and Depleted. Most rockfish species were in Precautionary condition, however, copper rockfish were Vulnerable in South Sound and quillback rockfishes were Vulnerable and Depleted in North and South Sound, respectively. Based upon stock assessments in adjacent coastal waters, yelloweye and canary rockfish were in Depleted status in North and South Sound. The relatively deepwater greenstriped rockfish, redstripe rockfish, and shortspine thornyheads were in healthy condition as were stocks of Puget Sound rockfish in South Sound. The health of rockfish stocks in Puget Sound is impacted by factors that remove excessive numbers of individuals, chronically alter or degrade their habitats and block life history pathways, or affect other species that increase predation, disease, or competition. Many stressors potentially limit the productivity of rockfish stocks in Puget Sound and include fishery removals, age truncation, habitat disruption, derelict gear, hypoxia, predation, and fishery removals of larger and older individuals. These stressors may have even greater impacts when stocks are at low levels causing, higher mortality rates that can drive stocks to dangerously low levels. Among the potential stressors, fishery removals, derelict gear, hypoxia, and food web interactions are the highest relative risks to rockfish in Puget Sound. Chemical contamination is a moderate risk manifested by undetermined reproductive dysfunction associated with exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds, loading of larvae with persistent organics via maternal transfer, exposure of pelagic larvae to toxics via contaminated prey, and exposure of long-lived adults to toxics like polychlorinated biphenyl compounds that accumulate over the life of the fish. These are most likely to impact rockfish living in urban areas but may be more widespread in the food web. Based upon this review of information and the condition of rockfish stocks in Puget Sound, a series of recommendations were developed to improve the conservation and management of rockfishes in Puget Sound. Principal recommendations are to improve our knowledge of rockfish in the ecosystem and their habitat requirements; better indentify, quantify, and control stressors on rockfish stocks; improve the management of rockfishes by evaluating the effectiveness of marine reserves, minimizing bycatch and accounting for all catch; and improve stock assessment by conducting comprehensive and frequent surveys, estimating life history parameters such as maturity, growth and mortality; better defining stocks and populations through genetic analysis; and developing quantitative models to reconstruct and analyze the abundance and demographic population structure.},

This study was conducted to measure species oxygen exposures in situ and to assess risks of low oxygen based on the hypothesis that species risk varies spatially and is dependent on the interaction of shelf oxygen dynamics with habitat pattern, species mobility, and tolerance to low oxygen. Here, we report concomitant observations of oxygen, depth, and habitat for the most common benthic and epibenthic megafauna on the southern California shelf (30–125 m). The study was conducted when oxygen concentrations were the lowest observed within the previous 30 years off southern California (2012–2014), yet hypoxic conditions ({\textless}1.42 ml l-1) were not observed. No significant oxygen exposure differences were observed among highly mobile, mobile, and sessile species due to the dynamic nature of the oxycline. Habitat affinities for the most abundant benthic megafauna (53 taxa) were discriminated among four different habitats. Highly mobile rockfish (Sebastidae) exhibited distributions suggesting less tolerance to low oxygen than most other taxa. Given the mosaic of consolidated and coarse-grained habitats that rockfish prefer, the onset of hypoxic conditions near the shelf break (-90–120 m) would likely compress local rockfish populations into less favourable habitat in a non-linear fashion.},

	volume = {75},
	abstract = {Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus; petrale sole, Eopsetta jordani; and rex sole, Glyptocephalus zachirus, are commercially important fiatfishes of the northeastern Pacific. They ranked first, third, and fourth respectively in 1973 Oregon flatfish landings (Bruneau et al.3). Despite the abundance of Dover, rex, and petrale sole in bottom trawl catches, their larvae are not common in plankton or mid-water trawl collections (Table 1; Ahlstrorn and Moser 1975). Dover sole apparently spawn in specific sites in offshore waters deeper than 400 m (Hagerman 1952; Demory4). Rex sole, which do not appear to have specific spawning sites, spawn between the 100-and 300-rn depth contours (Hosie5). Petrale sole are known to spawn in fairly well-defined locations in deep water (Ketchen and Forrester 1966; Alderdice and Forrester 1971). The rarity of Dover and rex sole larvae may be partially due to ABSTRACT Dover and rex sole larvae attain an exceptionally large size and have a long pelagic life. Dover sole larvae (9-65 mm standard length) were collected in mid-water trawls and plankton nets during all months of the year. Judging from growth of larvae and occurrence in bottom trawls of recently metamorphosed juveniles, Dover sole are pelagic çluring their first year of life. Large larvae (50-65 mm standard length) are probably pelagic for over a year and few apparently are recruited to benthic populations. Dover sole larvae were most common in oceanic waters beyond the continental slope and in the upper 50 m of the water column. The rex sole larvae captured were 5-89 mm long. Average size and stage of development of larvae increased from March through February, and juveniles were common on the bottom during winter on the outer shelf. Thus the pelagic phase usually lasts about a year. Both rex and Dover sole may utilize the outer continental shelf-upper slope region for a nursery during early benthic life. Petrale sole larvae (10-22 mm standard length) were rare. They were collected only from March to June and appear to have a pelagic life of about 6 mo. Age-group Ojuveniles, uncommon in bottom trawl collections, were only captured on the inner continental shelf in the fall.},

We contrast the results obtained for larval redfish with observations of scale-dependent variability in temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and zooplankton, which have been shown to be interrelated in other systems. In contrast with previous studies, our results show that the patterns of variance in temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and zooplankton are not scale dependent. Although the assumption of synopticity cannot be rejected, our results show that the variance in abundance of larval redfish is scale dependent and that it is much greater than the variances of the other variables considered. The contrasting pattern may be due to differences in the relative importance of physical and biological processes during the very early life history of marine fish. We suggest that sampling programs must be preceded by pilot studies designed to determine the effort required to obtain the most precise estimates of abundance given the limitations caused by the underlying sampling variability and the influence of physical processes.},

Here we evaluate the influence of ocean circulation on the dispersal of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) larvae along the central California coast using an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, driven at the surface by output from the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System. Thousands of floats simulating rockfish larval propagules, constrained to follow fixed depths, were released over a broad coastal area at 2-day intervals, and transported by simulated ocean currents at depths of 1, 7, 20, 40, and 70 m. Trajectory statistics are averaged across the 4-yr period from January 2000 through December 2003 to reveal mean trajectory direction, net displacement, fractional cross-shore loss, and duration of retention for different seasons. On average, near-surface propagules originating nearshore are transported offshore during the upwelling season, whereas deeper propagules move alongshore to the north. This vertical shear vanishes during winter, with most floats moving alongshore to the north, regardless of depth. After 35 days in the water column, typical transport distances were ∼50 km for floats remaining nearshore and ∼150 km for floats over the midshelf and slope. Implications for performance of marine reserves for rockfish conservation are discussed. Our results also provide evidence for a strong semiannual pattern of coastal retention rates, with high export of near-surface drifters during the upwelling season. In contrast, high rates of shelf retention occurred for releases at 20 m and deeper during summer, and at all depths during winter.},

Water clarity, an indicator of plume-influenced waters, was a significant predictor of seabird and prey densities throughout the survey area. Murres occurred within 20kmof the plume center of gravity, whereas shearwaters occurred 100 km north of the plume center of gravity, concurrent with the highest densities of prey fish. Global indices of collocation were relatively low between murres and prey compared with the high values between shearwaters and prey. Seabird densities were negatively correlated with plume size, suggesting that seabirds concentrate in the plume to maximize foraging effort. We conclude that variation in Columbia River plume size and location influences predator distributions, which increases predation pressure on prey, including threatened salmonid species.},

An alternative methodology (length-conditional) assumes each age sample taken is random with respect to that length. The length-conditional method uses the underlying population age structure to derive predictions and therefore has been limited to implementation inside the stock assessment model. This paper used simulation methods to evaluate the estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters outside the assessment model using the traditional method and a length-conditional method based on an equilibrium approximation to the population age structure derived from an estimate of the total mortality rate. Both random and length-stratified sampling designs were evaluated along with a range of sample sizes. With a random sampling design, both the traditional and approximate length-conditional methods produced unbiased estimates of Linf and K. However, only the approximate length-conditional approach produced unbiased estimates when samples were length-stratified. Variability in the length-at-age relationship was better estimated by the approximate length-conditional approach for both sampling designs. The approximate length-conditional method was robust to small errors in total mortality rate, but biased with increasing levels of mortality misspecification. With a reasonable estimate of total mortality, the approximate length-conditional approach may be a viable alternative to the traditional method when estimating growth parameters, especially the variability in growth.},

	abstract = {California's oil platforms are nearing the end of their productive lives and therefore will be decommissioned in the near future. These structures have been shown to be important habitats for both settlement and growth for reef fishes. Important information on the biological effects (i.e., loss of biomass and production) of different decommissioning options has not yet been explored in detail. An important step in the assessment of these different decommissioning options is to look at the potential loss of fish production and habitat under the different alternatives. Using the large amount of information available on fish abundances at these structures, we have created a model to estimate the standing stock of fishes and production that would be lost because of both partial (removal from surface to 85ft) and complete removal (the 2 decommissioning options being considered). Complete removal of a platform will likely eliminate most of its fish biomass; however, this study has shown that for rockfishes, which settle predominantly below 85 feet (26m) and move deeper as they age, partial removal through topping would leave more than 90\% of the fish biomass at the deeper platforms. Modeling of larval dispersal suggests that platforms provide an important opportunity for recruitment of fish larvae and that many larvae produced near the platforms would settle elsewhere in the region. The results presented here indicate that, even if topped, the potential contribution of platform habitat to biological resources (e.g., fish production) in this region is significant.

Even though in many countries they are moving to closed-loop simulations to assess the performance of different management procedures in data-limited situations, managers in most developing countries are still demanding information on stock status. In this study we use the common metric of harvest rate to evaluate and compare the performance of the following catch-only and length-only assessment models: Catch – maximum sustainable yield (Catch-MSY), depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DBSRA), simple Stock Synthesis (SSS), an extension of Catch-MSY (CMSY), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based Bayesian (LBB). In general, results were more biased for slightly depleted than for highly depleted stocks and for long-lived than for short-lived species. Length-based models, such as LIME, performed as well as catch-based methods in many scenarios, and among the catch-based models, the one with the best performance was SSS followed by CMSY.},

	abstract = {Overfished species of rockfish, Sebastes spp., from the Northeast Pacific experience high bycatch mortality because of 'barotrauma', a condition induced from the rapid change in pressure during capture. Field experiments show that it may be possible for rockfish to recover from barotrauma if quickly recompressed; however, no work has followed the physiological recovery of rockfish after recompression or determined whether it is possible for rockfish to survive barotrauma in the long term. Barotrauma was induced in adult black rockfish, Sebastes melanops Girard, from a simulated depth of 35m, followed by recompression. Blood and selected tissues (eye, heart ventricle, head kidney, liver, rete mirabile and gonad) were sampled at days 3, 15 and 31 post-recompression to evaluate the tissue- and physiologic-level response during recovery. No mortality from barotrauma occurred during the experiments, and feeding resumed in 80\% of both treatment and control fish. The primary injury in treatment fish was the presence of a ruptured swimbladder and/or a ruptured tunica externa (outer layer of swimbladder), which was slow to heal. Blood plasma was analysed for glucose, sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, insulin-like growth factor-1 and cortisol. Plasma analyses indicated no strong effects because of barotrauma, suggesting overall handling stress outweighed any effect from barotrauma. Rockfish with ruptured swimbladders may face compromised competency in the wild; however, it appears the majority of black rockfish decompressed from 35m have a high potential for recovery if recompressed immediately after capture. This research suggests recompression could be a valuable bycatch mortality reduction tool for rockfish in recreational fisheries. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

As of 2004, seven species of rockfish were classified as overfished by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Because rockfishes often experience barotrauma to varying degrees when forced up from depth, the management of discard mortality has been difficult. In this study, the macroscopic, morphological, and physiological responses to decompression of black rockfish S. melanops, blue rockfish S. mystinus, and yellowtail rockfish S. flavidus, all nearshore species, were investigated. The rockfish were adjusted to 4.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA; 35 m) over a period of 7-10 d in hyperbaric pressure chambers and when neutrally buoyant were rapidly brought to surface pressure in a simulated ascent. They were then examined for barotrauma injury, and the heart ventricle, head kidney, liver, gill, and pseudobranch were collected for histological analysis. We observed more macroscopic barotrauma indicators in black rockfish and blue rockfish than in yellowtail rockfish. Histological analysis showed emphysema was present in the heart ventricle of more than one-half of the black rockfish, 11\% of the blue rockfish, and none of the yellowtail rockfish. No other tissue had observable injury at the histological level that was attributable to barotrauma. The lack of injury at the tissue level for black, blue, and yellowtail rockfishes decompressed from 4.5 ATA is remarkable.},

A retrospective analysis of historical assessments for fish stocks off southeast Australia is conducted to quantify the extent of uncertainty associated with estimates of spawning stock biomass in absolute terms and when expressed relative to spawning stock biomass over a sequence of reference years. This approach to quantifying uncertainty captures more sources of uncertainty than alternative approaches, such as the estimate of the variance of terminal year spawning stock biomass from asymptotic methods, the extent to which estimates of spawning stock biomass vary among the sensitivity tests that form part of most assessments, and conventional retrospective analyses. By all measures, estimates of spawning stock biomass in absolute terms are much less certain than estimates of relative stock size (i.e. spawning stock biomass relative to a reference level), although application of most current harvest control rules rely on estimates of biomass in absolute terms. Overall, uncertainty in estimates of spawning biomass in absolute terms can be represented as a log-scale standard error of 0.37, while this standard error is 0.18 for estimates of spawning biomass in relative terms. There is considerable variation in among-assessment uncertainty in stock assessment outputs across species groups, with, for example, higher variation for assessments of chondrichthyans compared to other species.},

	abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock’ paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (age-size/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood’ paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is well-documented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

A method for constructing age-reading error matrices that accounts for both ageing bias and ageing imprecision is outlined. Simulation evaluation of this method suggests that it is able to estimate both ageing bias (assuming that one reader is unbiased) and ageing imprecision for relatively large sample sizes and for the ages that constitute the bulk of the ages in the sample. However, the performance of the method is poor when sample sizes are small, age-reading error is correlated among readers, when both readers are biased, and for ages that are poorly represented in the sample.

	abstract = {We report results from 28 yr of a midwater trawl survey of pelagic juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) conducted off the central California coast. The fishery-independent survey is designed to provide pre-recruit indices of abundance for use in groundfish stock assessments. Standardized catch rate time series for 10 species were developed from delta-generalized linear models that include main effects for year, station, and calendar date. Results show that interannual fluctuations of all 10 species are strongly coherent but highly variable, demonstrating both high- and low-frequency components. A similarly coherent result is observed in the size composition of fish, with large fish associated with elevated catch rates. In contrast, spatial and seasonal patterns of abundance show greater species-specific differences. A comparison of the shared common trend in pelagic juvenile rockfish abundance, derived from principal components analysis, with recruitments from five rockfish stock assessments shows that the time series are significantly correlated. An examination of oceanographic factors associated with year-to-year variability indicates that a signature of upwelled water at the time of the survey is only weakly related to abundance. Likewise, basin-scale indices (the Multivariate El Niño-Southern Oscillation Index, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and the Northern Oscillation Index) are poorly correlated with abundance. In contrast, sea level anomalies in the months preceding the survey are well correlated with reproductive success. In particular, equatorward anomalies in the alongshore flow field following the spawning season are associated with elevated survival and poleward anomalies with poor survival.

Area-weighted total length compositions of preflexion larvae in 2002 and 2003 were determined from ichthyoplankton survey data. Larval length-to-age transition matrices were estimated from data derived from the enumeration of daily otolith increments. In combination, these results were used to estimate daily rates of larval production and mortality during surveys conducted in those years. Daily rates of larval production were expanded to annual production rates using information developed from the long-term seasonal distribution of larvae in CalCOFT surveys. Total annual larval production was translated to total spawning biomass by calculation of the female population weight-specific fecundity derived from a length-based life table analysis of adult reproductive parameters. Our results indicate that there were 6953 -10 656 metric tons of bocaccio biomass (males and females {\textgreater}16 cm fork length) in the Southern California Bight during the survey years, which agrees with biomass estimates from a traditional stock assessment. Unique and problematic aspects of the reproductive biology of Sebastes are discussed, including multiple spawning, weight-specific fecundity that depends on size, and bias in fecundity data gathered from vitellogenic ovaries.},

To evaluate the effect of spatial heterogeneity in fishing mortality on yield, we constructed age-structured models that allowed for differing levels of fishing in three regions within the boundaries of a stock and explored alternative assumptions about the life stage in which density-dependent compensation operates. If the fishing mortality rate (F) is not excessive (i.e., F ≤ FMSY defined for the spatially homogeneous case; MSY, maximum sustainable yield), simulations demonstrated that minor to moderate spatial variation in fishing intensity does not impact sustainable yield. However, if fishing mortality is excessive (F {\textgreater} FMSY), spatial variation in fishing intensity often improves yield and can actually produce yields in excess of MSY when compensation occurs after dispersal, and the density-dependent recruitment rate is a function of the local density of adults. The yield premium generated in these simulations by postdispersal density dependence is due to a low level of compensatory mortality in heavily fished areas coupled with dispersal of propagules into these areas from lightly fished adjacent regions. © 2008 NRC.},

	abstract = {Quantifying scientific uncertainty when setting total allowable catch limits for fish stocks is a major challenge, but it is a requirement in the United States since changes to national fisheries legislation. Multiple sources of error are readily identifiable, including estimation error, model specification error, forecast error, and errors associated with the definition and estimation of reference points. Our focus here, however, is to quantify the influence of estimation error and model specification error on assessment outcomes. These are fundamental sources of uncertainty in developing scientific advice concerning appropriate catch levels and although a study of these two factors may not be inclusive, it is feasible with available information. For data-rich stock assessments conducted on the U.S. west coast we report approximate coefficients of variation in terminal biomass estimates from assessments based on inversion of the assessment of the model's Hessian matrix (i.e., the asymptotic standard error). To summarize variation among stock assessments, as a proxy for model specification error, we characterize variation among multiple historical assessments of the same stock. Results indicate that for 17 ground-fish and coastal pelagic species, the mean coefficient of variation of terminal biomass is 18\%. In contrast, the coefficient of variation ascribable to model specification error (i.e., pooled among-assessment variation) is 37\%. We show that if a precautionary probability of overfishing equal to 0.40 is adopted by managers, and only model specification error is considered, a 9\% reduction in the overfishing catch level is indicated.},

@phdthesis{rasmussen_comparisons_2010,
	title = {Comparisons of fish species inside and outside of marine protected areas off the south central coast of {California}},
	abstract = {From 2004-2008 and 2008-2009 Cal Poly University researchers conducted two separate tag and recapture studies of nearshore fish populations along California’s central coast. Three locations were sampled that have experienced different degrees of fishing pressure. Big Creek MPA has been closed to all fishing from 1993 onwards and is the farthest from port of all locations. Cambria lies closest to port of the three locations and because of this has the highest fishing pressure. Piedras Blancas lies midway between Cambria and Big Creek. Portions of Cambria and Piedras Blancas were designated as MPAs in 2007. Sampling protocols of these two different studies differed in bait used and size of commercial fish trap. An experiment was conducted to simultaneously compare the different trapping and baiting protocols from the prior studies to find a conversion factor that related catch per unit effort (CPUE), length frequency distributions and captured fish diversity between the two studies, thus providing a means to connect the two data sets for stock assessments and baseline MPA monitoring. Our sampling showed no significant difference in mean fish length or diversity between the two protocols for the five most common nearshore fish species captured, and three of the five species showed no significant difference in CPUE. Cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus), showed a significantly lower CPUE (50.5\%) using the MLPA monitoring protocols compared to the commercial fishing protocol and black and yellow rockfish (Sebastes chrysomelas) had a significantly higher CPUE (310\%) using the MLPA monitoring protocol. These findings provide a means of maintaining data continuity across the entire sample region and inclusion of earlier projects in the analyses of nearshore fish populations of the region. With the linkage of these two studies we provide important baseline data for the Cambria MPA from before it was established in 2007. Fish populations were compared on a year-to-year basis within each location, and between the different locations. I found several main factors helped to explain differences in size and abundance across time within individual locations, and across the three locations. These factors were inherent differences in habitat, establishment of MPAs, and changes in fishing pressure and post-larval recruitment. Cabezon were largest within Big Creek, followed by Piedras Blancas and Cambria which held the smallest fish, suggesting that fishing pressure is influencing fish size. However, cabezon were more abundant at Cambria than either other location suggesting that location is influencing abundance. Within Cambria, we are seeing an MPA effect with abundance within the MPA staying stable while the reference site is declining. Gopher rockfish (Sebastes carnatus) and black and yellow rockfish had similar trends with size and abundance between locations. Big Creek and Piedras Blancas held the largest fish, while Cambria was smaller. Both rockfish species were most abundant at Big Creek, followed by Cambria then Piedras Blancas. Size for these species is likely influenced by fishing pressure, and abundance is likely influenced by both fishing pressure and location. Both species increased in abundance 2004-2009 at Cambria, and this could be due to improved levels of post-larval recruitment. There is also a possible MPA effect for gopher rockfish at Cambria with a near significant divergence in size of fish between the MPA and reference site. Kelp greenling (Hexagrammos decagrammus) were similar in size and abundance between all sampling locations. There is a possible MPA effect at Cambria, with a significantly higher abundance than the reference site; however this difference predates the MPA’s establishment but could have been exacerbated by it. Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) size did not vary significantly between sites, but they were the most abundant at Cambria, followed by Piedras Blancas, then Big Creek, suggesting that habitat is influencing abundance. There was also a possible MPA effect on abundance of lingcod at Cambria with the MPA having a significantly higher abundance than the reference site. Similarly to the kelp greenling, these differences predated the MPA, but could have been exacerbated by its establishment, and abundance within the MPA has stayed stable, while the reference site was declining. Big Creek and Piedras Blancas have similar Shannon-Weiner diversity values, while Cambria has significantly lower. However, after MPA establishment at Cambria, the MPA has attained significantly higher diversity levels than the reference site. Over the short period of time that the Piedras Blancas and Cambria MPA have been established the populations within them have changed. However, there are no discernable trends in size, abundance and diversity between the MPA and reference sites at both locations. It is likely that with these slower growing, long-lived fish species that it will take more years for differences between the sites to manifest themselves.},

Widely available graphical techniques can be customized to provide an intuitive framework for this complex procedure. We illustrate a graphical approach using data from a stock of Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus). These data encompass typical problems in stock assessment, with missing data for some years and changes in age determination and survey methodologies midway through the time series. Preliminary visual inspection of the raw data reveals important features that must be accommodated in the model development. We tailor a state-space model to address these requirements and provide appendices that completely define the model and its statistical application. We suggest graphical methods for evaluating model output, including residuals and standard errors of population biomass. Such portrayals of uncertainty help define realistic limits to the information inherent in fishery data.},

S. elongatus, S. maliger and S. ruberrimus were the dominant rockfish species that were observed. S. elongatus and S. ruberrimus had similar depth distributions, but tended to segregate by habitat type. S. elongatus was most abundant on mud and cobble substrates that interspersed rocky areas. S. maliger and S. ruberrimus were both abundant in complex rock habitats, but tended to segregate by depth. For all three species there was an increase in size with depth. Hence, habitat type and depth were important influences on distribution patterns of this species group. © 1986 Dr W. Junk Publishers.},

Here, I generalize the model and extend its application to any pair of abundance indices for which the ratio of variances in the two indices can be estimated. I used the model to relate density indices from two years, CPUE values from two years, and the two CPUE–density combinations. Density estimates of nearshore reef fishes from the strait of Georgia, British Columbia, were obtained by SCUBA, and CPUE estimates were obtained by angling at the same sites. Among-site differences in both CPUE and density tended to be consistent between years. For quillback rockfish (Sebastes maliger), the relationship between CPUE and density was one of strict proportionality, as found by Richards and Schute over a different depth range.},

Oregonian province populations had higher haplotype diversity, with {\textgreater}70\% of the individuals representing a recent lineage absent in the Aleutian province. This suggests a limited northward dispersal across the zoogeographic boundary. The phylogeographic structure may be due to a founder effect in the Aleutian province or an ocean circulation driven pseudo-vicariance.

We sampled embryos and preparturition larvae opportunistically from 89 gravid quillback rockfish (Sebastes maliger) in Southeast Alaska. Because the developmental stage and sampling period were correlated with oil globule size, they were treated as covariates in an analysis of maternal age, length, and weight effects on oil globule size. Maternal factors were related to developmental timing for almost all sampling periods, indicating that older, longer, and heavier females develop embryos earlier than younger, shorter, or lighter ones. Oil globule diameter and maternal length and weight were statistically linked, but the relationships may not be biologically significant. Weight-specific fecundity did not increase with maternal size or age, suggesting that reproductive output does not increase more quickly as fish age and grow. Age or size truncation of a rockfish population, in which timing of parturition is related to age and size, could result in a shorter parturition season.

@techreport{roedel_common_1948,
	title = {Common {Marine} {Fishes} of {California}},
	abstract = {This bulletin is written with two objectives in mind. First, it is designed to provide authorized names for the more common marine fishes of California, in the hope that these names will be used in the fishing industry and by sportsmen. Second, it is designed to provide a ready reference from which the fisherman or the buyer can identify those species seen most often in the commercial and the sport catch. It is not presented as a treatise on our marine fishes, for it describes only a fraction of the species known from California. It is meant as a guide for any person interested in fish regardless of his technical background, so scientific terminology is avoided wherever possible.There have been two other bulletins of this sort published by the California Division of Fish and Game. The first, Number 28, was very broad in scope. It included both fresh-water and marine fishes, sharks, rays, and some invertebrates. The second,Number 45, treated sharks and rays in considerably more detail. The present publication is concerned only with the "true" bony fishes caught in the ocean off California, including the anadromous species—those which enter fresh water to spawn.By limiting this paper to marine fishes, we have been able to include a number of species which were not discussed in Bulletin 28. The criterion for selection was whether or not the fish in question was one appearing with reasonable frequency in either the sport or the commercial catch. Several fish of no importance either economically or as game fish come under this standard. They are, however, caught sufficiently often, usually by accident rather than design, to be the objects of interest and recurring questions as to their identity. It was not always easy to decide whether a given fish should be included, and no doubt some readers will wonder why one fish appears while another does not. The list as finally selected reflects the views of many interested people and is as representative as space would allow.The format follows that of Bulletins 28 and 45, and descriptions have been taken almost bodily from the former in several cases. In a number of groups of fishes, studies made in the intervening years have brought out easier means of identification and the descriptive paragraphs have been changed accordingly. Color is often a difficult character to describe, for a given fish may change its color in life, undergo further changes on death, and then have these shades completely altered after freezing or preserving. In addition, many species are iridescent and two people looking at the same fish will see different tones. The color patterns given herein are those believed typical of the species shortly after capture. Descriptions of both physical appearance and color refer to adult specimens and cannot be relied upon for young fish.Notes on the fishing season and fishing gear are drawn from records of the years 1941–1946 unless otherwise stated. The relative importance of the different species is subject to a great deal of variation. They have been ranked on the basis of 1946 catch records. Distribution records are given in general rather than specific terms in most instances. "Northern California" includes the area from the Oregon border south to Marin County; "Central California," that from Marin County south to Pt. Conception; and "Southern California," that from Pt. Conception to the Mexican border.},

For this pilot study, two fishes were captured on hook-and-line from 100 m, euthanized, and scanned in a 3 Tesla human MRI scanner. Analyses were made on each fish, one exhibiting swim bladder overinflation and exophthalmia and the other showing low to moderate swim bladder overinflation. Air space volumes in the body were quantified using image segmentation techniques that allow definition of individual anatomical regions in the three-dimensional MRIs. The individual exhibiting the most severe signs of barotrauma revealed the first observation of a gas-filled orbital space behind the eyes, which was not observable by gross dissection. Severe exophthalmia resulted in extreme stretching of the optic nerves, which was clearly validated with dissections and not seen in the other individual. Expanding gas from swim bladder overinflation must leak from the swim bladder, rupture the peritoneum, and enter the cranium. This MRI method of evaluating rockfish following rapid decompression is useful for quantifying the magnitude of internal barotrauma associated with decompression and complementing studies on the effects of capture and discard mortality of rockfishes. © 2008 NRC.},

Vision was functional 4 days after recompression and was improved after 1 month of recovery evidenced by individuals being able to track both smaller and faster-moving gratings. Our results suggest that, after recompression, rosy rockfish recover from exophthalmia fairly rapidly and perhaps fast enough to minimize significant adverse impacts on survival. This measured recovery from exophthalmia, in addition to evidence of high short-term, post-release survivorship, shows that recompression of unwanted rosy rockfish may be a viable management technique, and may be appropriate for other rockfish species, some of which are at low population densities due to high fishing pressure. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, rockfishes also thrive in areas largely devoid of corals and sponges. We compared the use of deep-sea corals and sponges by fish species in two ecosystems. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) densities were significantly correlated to structured seafloors at the scale of transects across both regions. Regional effects were not significant for most rockfish species and Pacific cod. At smaller scales only Pacific cod and rockfishes had significant associations with structure. The size of the individual fish and the size of the structure both had significant impacts on the distance of fish from structure, with smaller fish closer to structure and closer to smaller structure. Over half of the individual fishes surveyed were associated with sponges. The implication of this research is that the presence of structure increases the density of rockfishes, and removal of deep-sea corals and sponges is likely to reduce the overall density of rockfishes.},

Video analysis suggested that juvenile and adult rockfishes were more abundant on the seafloor in the rocky ridge area than on the surrounding sandy flats. Over the ridges, the distribution of rockfishes was uniformly low in the water column during nighttime surveys and higher during daytime surveys. The opposite pattern was observed in the video on the seafloor between night (high density) and day (lower density), indicating that fish in the water column during the day moved to the seafloor at night. Mean biomass of adult rockfishes for the rocky ridges was 1.54 × 104 tonnes based on acoustic data. The biomass of juvenile fish was estimated to be 9.2 × 102 tonnes.

All species were collected mainly below the thermocline, but thermocline depth was a poor predictor of the vertical distribution of pelagic juveniles. Increased stratification of the water column, however, led to a tendency for deeper centers of density for most species (13 of 15), and smaller rockfishes (≤25 mm standard length) occurred primarily below the thermocline. In the presence of weak or gradual thermoclines, Simpson's (1981) parameter of water column stratification may be a better measure of overall water column characteristics than thermocline depth alone, and it may be a better indicator of the effects of water column characteristics on the distribution of pelagic juvenile rockfishes.

Larval Pacific hake, shortbelly rockfish, and other rockfish were enumerated and length measurements were recorded. Time-depth contours of water density showed a clear boundary, defining the mixed layer along the σθ = 25.0 isopycnal, that appeared to fluctuate vertically on a 12-h cycle centered around 50 m depth. Temperature-salinity plots showed a distinctly different pattern in the mixed layer when compared with water below the pycnocline. Length-frequency distributions plotted by survey day indicated a relatively continuous input of small rockfish larvae into the survey area rather than a resident population growing progressively larger each day. Catches of rockfish larvae were much higher in nighttime tows and varied by survey day, but were unaffected by the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal. In contrast, catches of Pacific hake did not vary significantly on a diel basis, but were significantly variable by survey day and were influenced by the depth of the mixed layer. Catches of Pacific hake larvae were significantly higher during warm-saline periods (spicy water), while shortbelly rockfish were significantly less abundant under these conditions. Spectral analysis showed a clear 12-h cycle in the depth of the 25.0 isopycnal and a 24-h cycle in the catches of rockfish larvae, while Pacific hake catches and spiciness of the mixed layer appeared to have lower frequency cycles in excess of 48 h. © 2007 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The Southern California Bight (SCB) is a unique ecological and economic resource, home to some of the most productive coastal ecosystems, but also some of largest pollutant inputs in the United States. Historically, environmental monitoring of the coastal environment has been temporally intensive, but spatially focused on narrow areas closest to regulated discharges, providing a potentially biased perspective of overall coastal sediment quality. Beginning in 1994 and conducted approximately every five years thereafter, nearly 100 regulated, regulatory, non-governmental or academic organizations join forces to implement the SCB Regional Marine Monitoring Program (the Bight Program). The most recent Bight program sampled nearly 400 locations, from the head of tide in coastal estuaries to offshore basins 1000 m in depth, using a probabilistic survey design and measuring multiple indicators of sediment quality including chemistry, toxicity, and infauna. The three indicators were scored using regionally-developed assessment tools, and then combined for an integrated assessment of sediment quality. Results showed that the vast majority of SCB sediments do not have impacted sediment quality, but that not all habitats are in equally good condition. Most of the continental shelf is not impacted, despite the discharge of very large volumes (109 L/day) of treated wastewater discharges. In contrast, up to 50\% of the area in estuaries and 45\% of the area in marinas have impacted sediment quality. These generally quiescent waterbodies receive pollutant inputs from the region's extensively urbanized watersheds and high density of boating activities. Despite the relatively large extent of impacted sediment quality in embayments, sediment quality has been steadily improving in this habitat over the last decade based on surveys dating back to the 1998. The Bight Program has affected management actions in the region by focusing current efforts in habitats most impacted by poor sediment quality, and highlighting the improvements from previous management actions.},

	abstract = {To aid legislators, resource managers, and the general public, this paper summarizes and clarifies some of the issues and options that the federal government and the state of California face in decommissioning offshore oil and gas production platforms, particularly as these relate to platform ecology. Both local marine ecology and political climate play a role in decommissioning offshore oil production platforms. Compared to the relatively supportive political climate in the Gulf of Mexico for "rigs-to-reefs" programs, conflicting social values among stakeholders in Southern California increases the need for understanding ecological impacts of various decommissioning alternatives (which range from total removal to allowing some or all of platform structure to remain in the ocean). Additional scientific needs in the decommissioning process include further assessment of platform habitat quality, estimation of regional impacts of decommissioning alternatives to marine populations, and determination of biological effects of any residual contaminants. The principal management need is a ranking of environmental priorities (e.g. species-of-interest and marine habitats). Because considerable numbers of economically important species reside near oil platforms, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries should consider the consequences of decommissioning alternatives in their overall management plans. Management strategies could include designating reefed platforms as marine protected areas. The overarching conclusion from both ecological and political perspectives is that decommissioning decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Elucidating connections between ocean climate variability and change and recruitment of juvenile fishes to adult populations is critical for understanding variability in stock–recruit dynamics. Recruitment to adult rockfish populations in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is highly variable, leading to short-and long-term changes in abundance, productivity, forage availability, and potential fisheries yield. We used regional ocean model output, oceanographic data, and a 34-year time series of pelagic juvenile rockfish to investigate the interaction between changes in CCE source waters, as reflected by physical water mass properties, and recruitment variability. Specifically, variability of “spiciness” on upper water isopycnals explains a substantial fraction of the variation in pelagic juvenile rockfish abundance. High rockfish abundances correspond to cooler, fresher waters with higher dissolved oxygen (i.e., “minty”) conditions, indicative of Pacific subarctic water. By contrast, years of low rockfish abundance are associated with warmer, more saline, and more oxygen-deficient (i.e., “spicy”) conditions, reflecting waters of subtropical or equatorial origin. Transport and source waters in the CCE are key factors determining density-independent processes and subsequent recruitment to adult populations.},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is often seen as a major conservation issue, potentially threatening endangered species and decreasing biodiversity. In natural populations, the conservation implications of hybridization depends on both on anthropogenic factors and the evolutionary processes maintaining the hybrid zone. However, the timeline and patterns of hybridization in the hybrid zone are often not known. Therefore, species conservation becomes a concern when recent anthropogenic changes influence hybridization and not if hybridization is part of a long-term process. Here, we use sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, three nuclear introns and one nuclear exon to estimate the direction, geographic extent, frequency and possible timeline of hybridization between three rockfish species (Sebastes auriculatus, S. caurinus, S. maliger) in the Salish Sea, Washington, USA. We show that (i) introgression occurred much more frequently in the Salish Sea than on the outer coast, (ii) introgression was highly asymmetrical from S. maliger into the other two species, (iii) almost 40\% of individuals in the Salish Sea were hybrids, with frequency of hybrids increasing with isolation from the coast, and (iv) all hybrids were later generation backcrosses rather than F1 hybrids. Our results suggest long-standing low-level hybridization rather than recent onset of interbreeding because of human induced environmental change, possibly facilitated by specific environmental conditions in the sub-basins of the Salish Sea, and by differences in population sizes during recolonization of the area after the last glaciation. This rockfish hybrid system, with asymmetrical introgression and the maintenance of parental species, may prove useful to study both mechanisms that maintain species boundaries and that facilitate speciation in the presence of rapid environmental change.},

Complete descriptions are available for only about 12 of the 72 northeastern Pacific species. Allozyme analysis has been very useful in the identification of adult Sebastes, and our objective was to determine whether it could be equally useful in the identification of larvae and juveniles. Individually dissected tissues (muscle, liver, eye, heart) were assayed from Sebastes juveniles ({\textgreater}30 mm total length (TL)). The allozyme activity and resolution from the juveniles for 33 loci were indistinguishable from those obtained from adults. Larvae (5-12 mm TL) were prepared whole, and their allozyme expression varied by individual size and locus. A total of 32 loci were resolved from the larger (9-12 mm TL) larvae, but the allozyme activity was reduced in smaller (5-8 mm TL) larvae. Adequate resolution from the smaller larvae was obtained for 28 loci, a sufficient number to identify individuals to species. Allozyme analysis is a valuable technique to identify the species of Sebastes larvae and to aid in developing morphological and meristic descriptions. Other DNA-level techniques will likely further increase our ability to identify Sebastes larvae. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

We describe Bayesian generalized linear and hierarchical models for estimating species compositions from port sampling data and illustrate the application of each to several examples from California fisheries. Our hierarchical modeling approach provides a coherent statistical framework that can provide estimates of landings and uncertainty in the face of sparse and missing sampling data that compliment existing procedures for estimating landings. Furthermore, our methods provide ways to compare alternative model formulations and to maintain estimates of uncertainty when landings are aggregated across temporal or spatial scales. Our model structure is applicable to fisheries worldwide.},

Delay occurs because fishery management is political, and stricter management, which involves short-term economic loss, is unpopular. Informed of stock decline, managers often hesitate, perhaps pondering the uncertainty of scientific advice, perhaps hoping that a good year class will render action moot. However, management delay itself can have significant costs, when it exacerbates stock decline. To examine the biological consequences of delay, we simulated a spectrum of fisheries under various degrees of delay in management. Increased delay required larger catch reductions, for more years, to recover benchmark stock status (here, spawning-stock biomass at maximum sustainable yield). Management delay caused stock collapse most often under two conditions: (1) when the stock-recruitment relationship was depensatory, or (2) when catchability, unknown to the assessment, was density-dependent and fishing took juveniles. In contrast, prompt management resulted in quicker recoveries and higher cumulative yields from simulated fisheries. Benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield can be high from implementing management promptly.},

One collected data at the 43 Fathom Bank for 46 days, while the other was serially deployed at 13 locations for shorter periods (1-8 d). Passive-acoustic data were analysed for the presence of rockfish sounds. Potential sources of five pulsing sounds were identified from the optically estimated species compositions at each location, as well as from known rockfish recordings collected in aquaria. All sounds had a low frequency ({\textless}900 Hz). Some were short, individual pulses (≤0.1 s), others were repetitive. A repetitive pulsing from bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis) was the most commonly recorded sound and it occurred mainly at night. The daily calling rates at each site were quantitatively compared with the rockfish abundance estimates obtained from the active-acoustic survey, and they were positively correlated.

	abstract = {In temporally variable environments, longevity is generally considered to be a bethedging adaptation in which reproductive effort is spread across many years, increasing the probability that favorable conditions for larvae will be encountered at least some time in a female's life span. A long reproductive life span provides the potential for individual females to exhibit interannual differences in energy allocation patterns that may be age- or size-dependent. We examine the effects of maternal age and size on larval quality, fecundity, and timing of parturition in 5 species of live-bearing rockfishes in the genus Sebastes (blue, yellowtail, olive, gopher, and kelp rockfish), and compare these maternal effects with previously documented patterns in black rockfish Sebastes melanops. Larval quality was indexed by size (notochord length) and condition (lipid storage in the oil globule). Maternal effects were found for oil globule size in blue, yellowtail and gopher rockfish, for weight-specific fecundity in blue and yellowtail rockfish, and for parturition date in blue, yellowtail, and kelp rockfish. In all cases the maternal effects were similar to those reported for black rockfish, with increasing lipid provisioning of larvae, greater weight-specific fecundity, and earlier timing of parturition in the spawning season with increasing maternal age or size. No effect of maternal age or size on larval size was observed. In general, maternal effects were more evident in winter spawning species of the subgenus Sebastosomus (black, blue, olive, and yellowtail rockfish) than the spring spawning species of the subgenus Pteropodus (gopher and kelp rockfish). These results confirm that older and larger females in rockfish populations may contribute disproportionately to larval recruitment by producing higher quality larvae and more larvae per unit biomass, and releasing them at a different time than younger and smaller females. A shift in timing of parturition with female age may constitute a diversified bet-hedging strategy, providing a temporal spread of spawning effort within a maternal lineage, whereby successive female progeny release larvae at different times within the same year. © Inter-Research 2008.},

Metabolites involved in energy metabolism and basic amino acids were significantly increased upon acute exposure to 27°C (P {\textless} 0.05), and no change in metabolite levels occurred in the low water temperature group. However, certain fatty acid levels were elevated after cold stress (P {\textless} 0.05), and this effect was not observed in the 27°C group, suggesting that acute high and low temperature exposures caused different physiological responses.

Estimates of Fmsy and Fcrash were made from populations with maternal effects using either total larvae (proportional to eggs) or viable larvae (incorporating the maternal effect). Maternal effects have the largest impact upon estimated population productivity at high fishing rates. Estimates of Fmsy and Fcrash for cod were also affected by autocorrelated recruitment variability because of their reduced longevity compared with Pacific ocean perch.

A further complication is the bycatch of Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis); halibut bycatch limits, rather than single-species catch quotas, have been the primary factor regulating EBS flatfish harvest in recent years. To examine bycatch interactions among the EBS flatfish listed above, an equilibrium mixed-species multifishery model was developed. Equilibrium yield curves, scaled by recent average recruitment, are flat topped or asymptotically increasing, reflecting low fishing selectivity during the first several years of life and low growth relative to natural mortality. A linear programming analysis indicated that relaxation of the halibut bycatch constraint at the optimal solution of catch by fishery would produce approximately 20 times more flatfish yield than a similar relaxation of any flatfish catch quota. A strategy for establishing halibut bycatch limits that considers the foregone revenue in the halibut and flatfish trawl fisheries reveals how the choice of halibut bycatch limit is affected by the management goal for the flatfish complex.},

This study examines how conservation status and yield change when management units are established using genetic data versus treating the entire area as a single management unit. Simulations use a spatially structured, individual-based model that combines multilocus microsatellite genotypes and a traditional fish population dynamics model that establishes abundance-at-age by cohort. Results are considered in terms of marine fish species in general, and parameters in the model are based on Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region of Alaska. Population dynamics are projected under several management strategies, some of which establish management units based on the results of genetic testing and some that do not. Simulations incorporate annual stock assessments and fishing for 100 years. Results show that managed fishing can result in a reduction in stock sizes below target reference points when distinct populations are not managed based on the results of genetic testing. However, stock size is maintained at target levels and catches may increase when stocks identified using genetics are managed separately, even given error rates inherent to genetic testing.},

This study examines several management strategies for two marine fish species subject to IBD using simulation: Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) in the Aleutian Islands (AI) and northern rockfish (Sebastes polyspinis) in the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and AI. A one-dimensional stepping stone model was used to model IBD and was intended to mimic regions where marine species are exploited along a continental shelf. The performance of spatial assessment and management methods depended on how the range was split. Splitting anywhere within the managed area led to fewer demes falling below target and threshold biomass levels and higher yield than managing the entire area as a single unit. Equilibrium yield was maximized when each deme was assessed and managed separately and under catch cascading, in which harvest quotas within a management unit are spatially allocated based upon the distribution of survey biomass. The longer-lived rockfish declined more slowly than Pacific cod and experienced greater depletion in biomass under disproportionate fishing effort because of lower productivity. Overall, splitting a management area of the size simulated in the model improved performance measures, and the optimal management strategy grouped management units by demes with similar relative fishing effort.},

There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year-classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross-shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best-fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmental variables as covariates and there was some consistent response across stocks to these variables.

We found distinct spatial differences in the natal elemental signatures in the core region of the otoliths of postdispersal juvenile kelp rockfish Sebastes atrovirens collected along the coast of California, USA. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of individual otolith cores revealed detectable levels of Mn, Mg, Ba, and Sr. Using a Bayesian classification model, 2 unique elemental signature types were identified in both 2001 and 2002, and the signatures were chemically similar across years. In both years, locations received a mixture of natal types ('A' and 'B'), indicating the contribution of at least 2 chemically distinct sources to recruitment. The spatial pattern of the natal types varied among sites for both years. In 2001, Type A was nearly absent from the northernmost location, suggesting a southern origin and a limitation in the dispersal and contribution of this chemically identified natal type. In 2002, most locations had a mix of Types A and B, but Type A was most abundant in the south and least abundant in the central part of the spatial domain. However, it was not possible to specify the full extent of dispersal of either natal type. We demonstrated use of elemental signatures in the otolith core of post-dispersal individuals to evaluate larval dispersal patterns which may document the extent to which kelp rockfish populations along the California coast receive recruits from different chemically distinct sources. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {We summarize the life history characteristics of silvergray rockfish (Sebastes brevispinis) based on commercial fishery data and biological samples from British Columbia waters. Silvergray rockfish occupy bottom depths of 100-300 m near the edge of the continental shelf. Within that range, they appear to make a seasonal movement from 100-200 m in late summer to 180-280 m in late winter. Maximum observed age in the data set was 81 and 82 years for females and males, respectively. Maximum length and round weight was 73 cm and 5032 g for females and 70 cm and 3430 g for males. The peak period of mating lasted from December to February and parturition was concentrated from May to July. Both sexes are 50\% mature by 9 or 10 years and 90\% are mature by age 16 for females and age 13 years for males. Fecundity was estimated from one sample of 132 females and ranged from 181,000 to 1,917,000 oocytes and there was no evidence of batch spawning. Infection by the copepod parasite Sarcotaces arcticus appears to be associated with lower fecundity. Sexual maturation appears to precede recruitment to the trawl fishery; thus spawning stock biomass per recruit analysis (SSB/R) indicates that a F50\% harvest target would correspond to an F of 0.072, 20\% greater than M (0.06). Fishery samples may bias estimates of age at maturity but a published meta-data analysis, in conjunction with fecundity data, independently supports an early age of maturity in relation to recruitment. Although delayed recruitment to the fishery may provide more resilience to exploitation, managers may wish to forego maximizing economic yield from this species. Silvergray rockfish are a relatively minor but unavoidable part of the multiple species trawl catch. Incorrectly "testing" the resilience of one species may cause it to be the weakest member of the species complex.},

We apply this technique to 29 Pacific groundfish species across the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea – Aleutian Islands marine ecosystems. About 40\% of modeled stocks were estimated to exhibit temporal growth variation. In the majority of stocks, growth trends fluctuated annually across ages in a single year, suggesting that either there are shared environmental features that dictate growth across multiple ages or the presence of some systematic (within-year) observation errors. This method represents a novel way to use size-at-age data from fishery or other sources to test hypotheses about growth dynamics variability.},

No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices.

A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records.

	abstract = {Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have historically comprised a large proportion of catches in the nearshore recreational fishery in California, but declining populations of some species have led to increasingly restrictive management of the resource. This report summarizes new and existing data on rockfishes of the south central coast of California. In 2003, the California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo placed observers on commercial passenger fishing vessels (partyboats) from the region. By the end of 2005, we had observed catches from 258 trips (8,839 fisher hours). We appended these data to partyboat catch statistics collected by the California Department of Fish and Game from 1988 to 1998 and calculated annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) and mean sizes by species and year. The CPUE data by species fluctuate annually but rarely show consistent trends. The overall CPUE for 2004 and 2005 ranks in the top five of the twenty sampled years. Mean sizes have been consistent by species, generally just above the size of 50\% maturity. Comparing these sizes to historical data shows decreases in some species but not in others. A review of NOAA/NMFS triennial trawl data for the Point Conception area in the southern part of the study region suggests that the deeper shelf and slope species, with a few exceptions, show little evidence of long-term declines. In general, the south central coast rockfish resources, with the exception of bocaccio (S. paucispinis), have not shown strong evidence of a declining trend over the past 25 years.},

Intraspecific genetic variability is appreciable, with most individuals having unique haplotypes. Gene flow is substantial among some locations and others diverged significantly. Genetic divergences among sampling sites for S. alascanus indicate an isolation by geographic distance pattern. Genetic divergences for S. altivelis are unrelated to the hypothesis of isolation by geographic distance and appear to be more consistent with the hypothesis of larval retention in currents and gyres. Differences in geographic genetic patterns between the species are attributed to life history differences in their relative mobilities as juveniles and adults.},

Applying this method to length-composition observations for 47 groundfish species collected during a standardized trawl survey, we found maximum realized sample size to be related to both the number of hauls and individual fish sampled from those hauls. Sampling in excess of 20 fish from each haul produced little increase in most cases, with maximum realized sample size ranging from approximately 2 to 4 per haul sampled. Utilizing these maximum realized sample sizes as input values for stock assessment (analogous to minimum variance estimates) appropriately incorporates interannual variability, and may reduce over-emphasis on composition data.

We fit geostatistical delta-models to fisheries observer bycatch data for six species with a broad range of movement patterns (e.g., highly migratory sea turtles versus sedentary rockfish) and bycatch rates (percentage of observations with nonzero catch, 0.3\%–96.2\%). Random forests had better interpolation performance than the GMRF and GAM models for all six species, but random forests performance was more sensitive when predicting data at the edge of the fishery (i.e., spatial extrapolation). Using random forests to identify and remove the 5\% highest bycatch risk fishing events reduced the bycatch-to-target species catch ratio by 34\% on average. All models considerably reduced the bycatch-to-target ratio, demonstrating the clear potential of species distribution models to support spatial fishery management.},

As a result, use of underwater vehicles to assess the abundance and distribution of fishes has increased rapidly over recent years. However, a review of observations reported for 48 demersal marine fish taxa showed that almost all respond in some way to underwater vehicles. Whether or not movements or changes in behavior affect survey bias is more difficult to assess. A simple conceptual model is presented to evaluate relationships between stimulus intensity, distances from the vehicle where reactions occur, and survey bias. Largest bias is caused by attraction or avoidance that occurs outside the field of cameras or observers. While light level and vehicle speed have been explored experimentally in a few cases, much remains to be learned about how bias varies among species, age groups, different vehicles, and operating conditions. Given poor understanding of survey bias, we recommend that surveys be conducted with minimum possible variation in operations and that vehicle time is devoted to experimental evaluation of methods. There is no good substitute for direct observations on fish behavior, distribution, and abundance; and survey design can be improved through experimentation. © 2008 NRC.},

In summer the most intense and persistent layer lay at 220–230 m; others were at 330–400, 185, and 90 m. In fall the main and deep layers were shallower. Vertical migration occurred at dusk and dawn. The main layer frequently split into three parts with different vertical migration patterns. At dawn a layer gradually appeared at about 90 m, intensified rapidly, and descended to the daytime level.Catches show fishes are associated with the sound scattering layers. The largest day catches were from the main layer. At night fish did not appear to be concentrated to the same extent relative to the layers. The largest night catches were usually smaller than the largest day catches and shallower.Myctophids of eight species, four common, made up 80\% of the catch, chauliodontids 6\%, argentinids 4\%, melamphids, rockfish, and larval flatfish 2\% each. The remaining 2\% comprised 27 species in 21 families. Depth distribution and vertical migration varied considerably with the species.Myctophids with gas-filled swim bladders were apparently dominant in the main layers whereas species without swim bladders — stomiatoids, argentinids, and melamphids — or myctophids with fat-filled swim bladders were dominant below the main layer and in the deep layer. Fish with no swim bladders or with fat-filled ones may make longer vertical migrations than those with gas-filled bladders.},

To do this, we sampled forage fish communities using a seabird predator, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata), at six coastal study sites from Japan to California. We investigated whether take of forage fishes was related to local marine conditions as indexed by sea surface temperature (SST). SST was concordant across sites in the eastern Pacific, but inversely correlated between east and west. Forage fish communities consisted of anchovy (Engraulis spp.), sandlance (Ammodytes spp.), capelin (Mallotus spp.), and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.), among others, and take of forage fish varied in response to interannual and possibly lower-frequency oceanographic variability. Take of primary forage species were significantly related to changes in SST only at the eastern sites. We found synchrony in interannual variation of primary forage fishes across several regions in the eastern Pacific, but no significant east-west correlations. Specifically in the Japan Sea, factors other than local SST or interannual variability may more strongly influence forage fishes.

To effectively augment fisheries, however, reproductive output must increase within the bounds of MPAs so that larvae can be exported to surrounding areas and seed the region. In response to dramatic declines of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) in southern California by the late 1990s two large MPAs, the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs), were established in 2001. To evaluate whether the CCAs affected rockfish productivity we evaluated the dynamics of 8 species that were, and 7 that were not, historically targeted by fishing. Abundances of 6/8 targeted and 4/7 non-targeted species increased regionally from 1998 to 2013. These upturns were probably affected by environmental conditions in addition to changes in fishing pressure as the presence of most species correlated negatively with temperature, and temperature was lower than the historic average in 11/15 years. Seventy-five per cent of the targeted, but none of the non-targeted species increased at a greater rate inside than outside the CCAs while controlling for environmental factors. Results indicate that management actions, coupled with favourable environmental conditions, facilitated the resurgence of multiple rockfish species that were targeted by intense fishing effort for decades.},

In southern California, oceanographic conditions vary widely from east to west as the offshore region is impacted by cool, southern flowing California Current water, while the inshore is typically warmer and more productive. We investigated how patterns of distribution and abundance of larval, genetically identified rockfishes related to environmental conditions off southern California, the world's center of rockfish Sebastes spp. species diversity. The rockfish assemblage was dominated by small and short-lived species not typically targeted by recreational or commercial fishing (i.e. shortbelly S. jordani and squarespot S. hopkinsi rockfishes), but also contained moderate abundances of a few larger, targeted species (bank S. rufus and bocaccio S. paucispinis rockfishes). Spawning locations of many species were affected by environmental variability, as abundances of young (0 to 2 d old), targeted larvae were mainly found offshore in the cool, low primary production waters that also were relatively shallow and contained hard substrate. In contrast, untargeted species were more widespread and correlated positively only with hard substrate. Hotspots of species richness and targeted species were high within a large managed region, the Cowcod Conservation Area, indicating that it is effectively protecting important rockfish spawning habitat. This research highlights the need to account for environmental variation in habitat and assemblage structure when conducting marine spatial planning.},

	abstract = {Since fishery management regulations have shifted much of the groundfish trawl effort in the northeastern Pacific from the continental shelf to the slope, fishery impacts on unassessed demersal slope rockfish species like the aurora rockfish (Sebastes aurora) may have increased. Understanding the life history of these species is a critical first step in developing management strategies to protect them from overharvest. In this study we employ cross-dating methods to validate the annual periodicity of growth increments and investigate the age, growth and maturity of aurora rockfish, a species for which life history information is quite limited. Specimens were collected on an opportunistic basis from Oregon commercial landings and from research cruises, over the years 2003-2006. Age was estimated for 438 individuals using otoliths processed via the break-and-burn method. The maximum estimated age was 118 years for females (n=324) and 81 years for males (n=114). The von Bertalanffy growth function showed that males grow faster and reach a smaller maximum size than females (males: Linf =34, K=0.09, t0=-1.9; females: Linf=37, K=0.06, t0=-5.5), though both sexes demonstrate relatively slow growth. Visual assessment of ovaries showed that the aurora rockfish is a synchronous spawner with parturition occurring in May and June off Oregon. Female age and length at 50\% maturity were calculated at 12.6 years and 26 cm, respectively (n=307).

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. "joint species distribution" or "multispecies occupancy" models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed "biogenic habitat") improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally difficult to estimate for individual fish stocks, and its average value for marine fishes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., five biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing efforts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Specifically, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockfish increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textless}0.6) to 2011 (average:{\textgreater}0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockfish rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockfishes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly influenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the bias-variance tradeoff between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of difficult-to-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-specification of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

Previous iterative reweighting approaches to weighting compositional data are generally ad hoc, do not propagate uncertainty about data-weighting when calculating uncertainty intervals, and often are not re-adjusted when conducting sensitivity or retrospective analyses. We therefore incorporate the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution into Stock Synthesis, and propose it as a model-based method for estimating effective sample size. This distribution incorporates one additional parameter per fleet (with the option of mirroring its value among fleets), and we show that this parameter governs the ratio of nominal (“input”) and effective (“output”) sample size. We demonstrate this approach using data for Pacific hake, where the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and an iterative reweighting approach previously developed by McAllister and Ianelli (1997) give similar results. We also use simulation testing to explore the estimation properties of this new estimator, and show that it provides approximately unbiased estimates of variance inflation when compositional samples capture clusters of individuals with similar ages/lengths. We conclude by recommending further research to develop computationally efficient estimators of effective sample size that are based on alternative, a priori consideration of sampling theory and population biology.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest ("derived quantities") are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional "plug-in" estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new "epsilon" estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

We use theoretical arguments and simulation modeling to demonstrate that SSCOM can, in some cases, estimate population status from catch data. Next, we use meta-analysis to estimate effort dynamics for US West Coast groundfishes before and after fisheries management changes in the mid-1990s. We apply the SSCOM using meta-analytic results to data for eight assessed species and compare results with stock assessment and data-poor methods. Results indicate general agreement among all three methods.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

	abstract = {A scientific bottom trawl survey targeting Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) occasionally yields extraordinary catch events (ECEs) in which catch-per-unit-area is much greater than usual. We hypothesize that ECEs result from trawl catches of fish shoals. We developed mixture distribution models for positive catch rates to identify spatial covariates associated with ECEs or normal trawl catches and used simulation modeling to contrast the performance of mixture distribution and conventional log-linear models for estimating an annual index of positive catch rates. Finally, mixed-effects modeling was applied to multispecies data to evaluate the hypothesis that ECEs are related to shoaling behaviors. Results show that mixture distribution models are often selected over conventional models for shoaling species and that untrawlable habitat has a positive effect on rockfish densities. Simulation shows that mixture distribution models can perform as well as or better than conventional models at predicting positive catch rates. Finally, model selection supports the hypothesis that shoaling behaviors contribute to the occurrence of ECEs. We propose that greater understanding of ECEs and shoaling habitat selection could be useful in future spatial management and survey design and that mixture distribution models could improve methods for estimating annual indices of abundance.},

	abstract = {Scientific survey data are used to estimate abundance trends for fish populations worldwide, and are frequently analyzed using delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMMs). Delta-GLMMs incorporate information about both the probability of catch being non-zero (catch probability) and the expected value for non-zero catches (catch rates). Delta-GLMMs generally incorporate year as a main effect, and frequently account for spatial strata and/or covariates. Many existing delta-GLMMs do not account for random or systematic differences in catch probability or rates in particular combinations of spatial strata and year (i.e., space-time interactions), and do not recognize potential correlation in random space-time interactions between catch probability and catch rates. We therefore develop a Bayesian delta-GLMM that estimates correlations between catch probability and rates, and compare it with either (a) ignoring year-strata interactions, (b) modeling year-strata interactions as fixed effects, or (c) estimating year-strata interactions in catch probability or rates as independent random effects. These four models are fitted to bottom trawl survey data for 28 species off the U.S. West Coast. The posterior median of the correlation is positive for the majority (18) of species, including all five for which the posterior distribution has little overlap with zero. However, estimating this correlation has little impact on resulting abundance indices or credible intervals. We therefore conclude that the correlated random model will have a little impact on index standardization of the West Coast bottom trawl dataset. However, we propose that the correlated model can quickly identify correlations between occupancy probability and density, and provide our code to allow researchers to quickly identify whether such a correlation is likely to be significantly different from zero for their chosen data set. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear ("catchability"). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels ("vessel effects"), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time ("vessel-year effects") can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs. © 2014.},

How individuals use space may also be important to the management of the species and for understanding behavioral processes like optimal foraging or territoriality. We used an acoustic tracking system (VRAP) to examine patterns in home range size and movement behavior for 3 demersal fishes in Puget Sound: lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Data were collected over 8 wk in the summer of 2006 and 3 wk in the winter of 2007. Home ranges were relatively small (∼1500 to 2500 m2) and did not differ among species. During the summer, lingcod had larger home ranges during the day than at night. Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern. Similar results were seen for quillback rockfish. While the arena of resource management often requires us to simplify complex systems, our results illustrate that such simplification may be difficult, and will depend ultimately on detailed behavioral data. © Inter-Research 2009.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

Short-term impacts with experimental cod ends were analyzed. Six cod ends were used as treatments: 76-, 114-, 127-, and 140-mm diamond mesh, and 114- and 127-mm square mesh. Three response variables were used to compare these cod ends: utilized catch weight (weight of marketable-sized fish), size-discard catch weight (weight of fish discarded due to small size), and giller weight (weight of fish wedged between meshes). Species composition differed between the “inner nearshore” area (0–91 m depth) and the “outer nearshore” area ({\textgreater}91–183 m depth). For all cod ends, the inner nearshore had a consistently greater percent total discard than the outer nearshore. The individual cod end results showed that the 76-mm diamond gave excessively high size-discard rates for both areas. The 114-mm square mesh performed well in the outer nearshore, giving high utilized weight per hour and low size-discard weight per hour. The 114-mm diamond mesh did better in the inner nearshore, where a larger percentage of flatfish were utilized, giving a reasonable utilized weight per hour and also a low size-discard weight per hour. © 1996 American Fisheries Society.},

Such effects imply a converse impact when adult abundance is severely reduced by fishing: increases in forage species may then cause lagged, apparently depensatory decreases in juvenile survival. Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following Severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research, and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development.},

Conservative assessments (low biomass estimates for which there is only a small probability that biomass is actually lower) are favored during development when loss is measured as the relative departure from the best quota for each year. But if loss is measured as absolute departure from the best quota, it is generally better to base the quota on the biomass estimate for which there is nearly a 50\% chance that the stock is smaller. Deliberate overfishing (probing) is not favored under either loss measure. Losses can be reduced with minimum biomass surveys and closed areas that directly cushion fishing mortality rates from being more than 50\% too low or high.},

A gravity model for spatial effort allocation predicts substantial side effects of marine protected areas of discarding of particular species on nontarget species/grounds due to redistribution of fishing effort. Multispecies, multiground delay-difference models are used in conjunction with the gravity model for spatial effort distribution to predict long-term population responses to various regulatory strategies. This simulation suggests that species composition and spatial structure of the fishery are changing slowly due to reduction in abundance of long-lived species, but rapid collapses of target stocks are unlikely due to spatial redistribution of effort in response to local declines. We question quota management (individual vessel quotas) can be safely implemented due to extreme uncertainty about current stock sizes and suggest that a better strategy may be to simply denominate fishing rights as individual effort quotas while providing protection for sensitive stocks through carefully placed marine protected areas.},

The model demonstrates that modest dispersal rates of older fish can substantially reduce abundance within protected areas compared with predictions from models that ignore such dispersal. The strength of compensatory improvements in postsettlement juvenile survival is the most critical factor in determining whether a reserve network can rescue populations from the impacts of severe overharvesting. We use the model to compare specific alternative proposals for protected area networks along the California coast, as mandated through California's Marine Life Protection Act, and show that achieving the goals of the Act depends primarily on the fisheries management regulations outside of protected areas and that the size and configuration of MPAs has little impact. © 2007 NRC.},

In this paper, larval connectivity patterns in the Southern California Bight are explored using 2 quantities: potential and realized larval connectivity. Potential connectivity is defined as the probability of larval transport from a source to a destination location and is quantified using Lagrangian particle simulations. Realized connectivity is the product of potential connectivity with larval production and can be used to estimate larval settlement patterns. Potential and realized connectivity patterns are quantified for kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus, kelp rockfish Sebastes atrovirens, and red abalone Haliotis rufescens, 3 species with a range of larval dispersal characteristics. Connectivity patterns were found to be both heterogeneous, with locations having different source and destination strengths, and asymmetric, with directionality in larval transport. Both potential and realized connectivity were strongly influenced by the length and timing of the spawning season as well as planktonic larval duration. For kelp bass and kelp rockfish, a strong correspondence was found between realized and potential destination locations, suggesting that circulation processes have a dominant role in shaping the spatial distribution of these 2 species. Strong temporal variability in realized larval connectivity was observed on seasonal and inter-annual time scales (particularly between El Niño and La Niña conditions).

Radiometric ages agreed well with growth zone counts, giving substantial validity to them and suggesting longevity of 50 years or more Sebastes rufus. Otolith length, width, area, perimeter and weight were evaluated as criteria for determining age. All parameters were highly correlated with growth zone counts, with otolith weight showing the most promise as an age predictor. Von Bertalanfy growth parameters were L\${\textbackslash}sbınfty\$ = 488, K = 0.048, t\${\textbackslash}sb0\$ = \$-\$8.372 for 81 males and L\${\textbackslash}sbınfty\$ = 594, K = 0.039, t\${\textbackslash}sb0\$ = \$-\$6.96 for 86 females. Sebastes rufus are long-lived, slow growing and reach reproductive maturity at 10-15 years of age.},

We developed gen - eralized additive models (GAM) and spatially predictive maps of rockfish abundance at the individual species level using habitat descriptors collected from visual surveys and fine-scale bathy metry. We advanced beyond presence/absence and presence only models to create predictive maps of fish density (100 m-2) and biomass (kg 100 m-2) for Sebastes rosaceus (rosy rockfish) and S. constellatus (starry rockfish), both common species in commercial and recreational fisheries along the central coast of California. Selected models included co-variables of seafloor depth, complexity, substratum type, and heterogeneity. Predicted density and biomass of both species were highest in areas of complex rock on the continental shelf off Points Lobos and Sur at 50-90 (S. rosaceus) and 80-120 m (S. constellatus) water depth. Our results will be useful both in stock assessments of these data-poor species as well as in allocation of fishing effort, catches, and other space-based management decisions.},

	abstract = {A major clam fishery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5-3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

In addition, widely available software allows for fitting these models and for elaboration of them to learn about the effects of additional factors such as temperature, species interactions, management practices, the introduction of an invasive species, or other known environmental variables.

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program was formed in 2006 to participate in the monitoring of marine reserves established through California’s Marine Life Protection Act.

Rockfish predominated in most trawl catches. Among areas, numbers of rockfish species declined northward, from 19–21 in the Oregon–Vancouver Island region to 5 off Unalaska Island. Within areas, maximum numbers of species were caught at intermediate depths — usually 80–139 fath (146–254 m). With rare exceptions, Pacific ocean perch was the predominant rockfish species in the trawl catches throughout the study area, although its relative abundance declined from north to south.Within areas, ocean perch catch rates were usually maximal at intermediate depths — 120–139 fath (220–254 m) in summer and substantially deeper in winter. Juvenile fish usually occupied shallower depths than adults, but were often in the company of large adults. Among areas, summer catch rates were relatively high off southwest Vancouver Island and southeastern Alaska and in the western Gulf of Alaska. Off Vancouver Island, summer catch rates were higher than winter catch rates, particularly for large adults of both sexes. Echo-sounder records indicated schools were frequently unavailable to the on-bottom trawl used in this survey.Ocean perch in the northeast Pacific Ocean were categorized, tentatively, into B.C.- and Gulf-types, whose mutual boundary is Dixon Entrance. Separation was based on differential size distributions and year-class strengths.Survival rates among year-classes were evidently quite variable, particularly for the Gulf stock west of Cape Spencer.Qualitatively, ocean perch abundance generally increased from south to north in the study area.Bottom-water temperatures varied inversely with depth and latitude. Among areas, temperature range at depths of maximal ocean perch catch rate was 4.5–7.7 C, but in high-abundance areas the temperatures did not exceed 6.0 C. Seasonally, temperature at depths of maximal catch rate varied approximately 1.5 C.},

Consistency of otolith readings between two readers varied inversely with numbers of translucent (or opaque) zones — from 100\% agreement for 0-zone otoliths to 23\% for 19-zone otoliths. Variability in zone counts between two readers was not great — 85\% ± 1 zone for 3- to 24-zone otoliths — and the dispersion was near-normal about zero. Validity of otolith readings was established by demonstrating the annual formation of the translucent zone for juvenile fish, and by detecting the temporal passage of dominant year-classes among juveniles and adults.Age–length relationship varied inversely with depth off British Columbia, and inversely with latitude (or longitude) in the study region. Off Vancouver Island (48°48′N lat), two partially mixed stocks with near-opposite seasonal availability maxima were delineated, from bathymetric age–length and catch-rate data. Latitudinally, there was a sharp discontinuity in the age–length relationship at Dixon Entrance (54°40′N lat).Ranges of von Bertalanffy growth parameters were as follows: L ∞ , 37.2–48.2; K, 0.078–0.169; and t o , − 0.4 to − 1.8. No geographical trend was evident for any parameter. Values of L ∞ were larger for females, while values of K were smaller. Considerable variation in parameter values exists among studies on Pacific ocean perch from the western Gulf of Alaska.Age-weight relationship was generally sigmoid in shape. Values of W ∞ ranged from 791 to 1686 g. Annual weight increments were maximal at ages 7–11.},

	abstract = {U.S. federal fisheries managers are mandated to obtain optimum yield while preventing overfishing. However, optimum yield is not well defined and the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has often been applied to provide an upper bound for the optimum yield value, but determining the MSY, identifying the relative biomass that produces MSY and the associated fishing rate required (FMSY) is difficult. The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages groundfish stocks off the U.S. west coast, has employed proxy targets in lieu of species-specific estimates of MSY, BMSY, and FMSY. The proxy targets are life history specific, with flatfish stocks managed using a target BPROXY of 0.25 of unfished biomass and a harvest control rule that applies an exploitation rate equal to a spawner-per-recruit harvest rate of F0.30, with a linear reduction of catch to zero if the stock falls below 5\% of unfished biomass (BLIMIT). A management strategy evaluation was performed to explore the performance of the current harvest control rule applied to flatfish stocks to meet management goals, along with alternative harvest control rules that explore varying the values for BPROXY BLIMIT, and FSPR. Each of the harvest control rules explored maintained stocks at or near BPROXY when stock-recruit steepness was 0.85 or greater, with very low probabilities of reducing relative biomass below a minimum stock size threshold (set at 0.50 BPROXY of each harvest control rule). The most aggressive harvest control rule, which applied a BPROXY of 0.20 and a target harvest rate of F0.25, led to fishing rates that exceeded the operating model FMSY values for low steepness (0.75), reducing the stock below BPROXY with catches exceeding MSY. Trade-offs exist among alternative harvest control rules where the more aggressive harvest control rules resulted in higher average catches, but with an increase in the average annual variation in catches and a decrease probability of the relative biomass being with 10\% of the BPROXY. The trade-offs among the performance metrics and alternative harvest control rules coupled with the risk to the resource across a range of life histories should be carefully considered by fishery managers when selecting a harvest control rule that will meet the goals of management.},

	abstract = {Variability in larval supply introduces uncertainty into the management of marine fisheries. This variability can confound short-term population projections of both traditional and spatially explicit models of fishery productivity. A potential remedy is the use of physical oceanographic variables, such as an upwelling index or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, as proxies for recruitment year class strength. We describe a method for incorporating proxy information into population models for fishery management. Our model of a conventional fishery (using kelp rockfish as an example) suggested that proxies were effective in predicting actual larval survival if there was a strong correlation between the proxy and larval survival (r {\textgreater} 0.8), when recruitment was highly variable. Model outputs were most useful when used to hindcast rather than forecast the population trajectory. A spatial extension of the model for marine protected areas (MPAs) confirmed those results and revealed that 1) larval dispersal distances did not affect the utility of the proxy, and 2) adult home range size influenced whether before:after or inside:outside biomass ratios provided a more effective metric of MPA success. We found that proxies greatly improved model projections over short time scales, but that projections beyond the time needed for recruits to enter the fishery were less effective. This work provides an example of how information about environmental variability affecting recruitment can be incorporated into fishery models to improve management.},

	abstract = {In Puget Sound, WA (USA), rockfish (Sebastes spp.) have significantly declined in abundance, with multiple petitions to list individual species under the Endangered Species Act. In order to better understand the ecological legacy of rockfish fishing to the Puget Sound ecosystem, the local history of rockfish exploitation was reviewed, focusing on the socioeconomic forces and management decisions which influenced the trajectory of landings. Rockfish have always been harvested for human consumption in the region, but over time exploitation patterns have changed from an opportunistic subsistence activity by indigenous peoples, to a year-round target of commercial and recreational interests. Annual commercial and recreational harvests together peaked (almost 400. mt) in the early 1980s as anglers' attitudes changed, gear technology improved, rockfish became more familiar to the market, human population increased, and agency programs promoted fisheries to sustain employment. Rockfishes were generally not managed intensely or with conservation goals in mind until the late 1980s, in part due to scientific shortcomings and a lack of resources. By the time management actions were deemed necessary, the greatest harvest had already occurred. However, the low intrinsic productivity of most rockfish species suggests that the legacy of fishing will remain for years to come. As managers strive to restore the integrity and resilience of Puget Sound, they must realize the significance of historical fishery removals to the ecosystem and use the proper social and economic incentives to drive individual behavior toward these ecosystem goals. © 2010.},

	abstract = {We describe the application of two types of stereo camera systems in fisheries research, including the design, calibration, analysis techniques, and precision of the data obtained with these systems. The first is a stereo video system deployed by using a quick-responding winch with a live feed to provide species- and size composition data adequate to produce acoustically based biomass estimates of rockfish. This system was tested on the eastern Bering Sea slope where rockfish were measured. Rockfish sizes were similar to those sampled with a bottom trawl and the relative error in multiple measurements of the same rockfish in multiple still-frame images was small. Measurement errors of up to 5.5\% were found on a calibration target of known size. The second system consisted of a pair of still-image digital cameras mounted inside a midwater trawl. Processing of the stereo images allowed f ish length, fish orientation in relation to the camera platform, and relative distance of the fish to the trawl netting to be determined. The video system was useful for surveying fish in Alaska, but it could also be used broadly in other situations where it is difficult to obtain species-composition or size-composition information. Likewise, the still-image system could be used for fisheries research to obtain data on size, position, and orientation of fish.},

Multivariate tests, performed on freshwater, marine, and combined data matrices, repeatedly identified a gradient associating later-maturing fishes with higher fecundity, small eggs, and few bouts of reproduction during a short spawning season and the opposite suite of traits with small fishes. A second strong gradient indicated positive associations between parental care, egg size, and extended breeding seasons. Phylogeny affected each variable, and some higher taxonomic groupings were associated with particular life-history strategies. High-fecundity characteristics tended to be associated with large species ranges in the marine environment. Age at maturation, adult growth rate, life span, and egg size positively correlated with anadromy. Parental care was inversely correlated with median latitude. A trilateral continuum based on essential trade-offs among three demographic variables predicts many of the correlations among life-history traits.

The newly created EBS reference chronology was then compared with a reference chronology previously created for Pacific halibut from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Adult Pacific halibut age-validation samples from the EBS were also analyzed for 14C and modeled to validate age-estimation accuracy. A Bayesian model was developed and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate model parameters and adult Pacific halibut ageing bias. Differences in reference chronologies between ocean basins were reflected in a large deviance information criterion (ΔDIC) between models, supporting the hypothesis that two separate coupled-function models were required to adequately describe the data, one each for the EBS and GOA. We determined that regionally specific GOA and EBS oceanography plays a considerable role in the Δ14C values and must be taken into consideration when selecting a reference chronology for bomb-produced 14C age-validation studies. The age-validation samples indicated that the current ageing methodology used in Pacific halibut assessments is accurate and has provided accurate age assignments for Pacific halibut in the EBS.},

Among Pacific ocean perch samples, θ ranged from 0.001 to 0.056. Canonical discriminate analysis of multilocus genotypes and neighbour-joining analysis of pairwise genetic distances between samples both indicated the presence of three populations, one off the west coast of Vancouver Island (the Vancouver Island population) and two co-existing populations in Queen Charlotte Sound, Dixon Entrance and along the west coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands (the eastern and western QCI populations). Pacific ocean perch of the eastern and western QCI populations were caught in close proximity to each other, but individual samples showed little evidence of admixture. Fall and spring samples collected within geographic areas were genetically similar, indicating seasonally stable population structure. Restricted gene flow between the Vancouver Island and the two more northerly populations may result from limited adult dispersal and larval retention within the California Current and Alaska Gyre, respectively, but the presence of two populations within Queen Charlotte Sound cannot be explained entirely by larval retention hypotheses. The presence of two Pacific ocean perch populations in central British Columbia has implications for fisheries management.},

	abstract = {A multidisciplinary assessment of benthic rockfishes (genus Sebastes) and associated habitats in deep water was conducted in Soquel Submarine Canyon, Monterey Bay, California. Rock habitats at depths to 300 m were identified by using bathymetric and side-scan sonar imaging, verified by visual observations from a manned submersible, mapped and quantified. Species composition, abundance, size, and habitat specificity of fishes were determined by using a video camera and parallel laser system along transects made by a submersible. We counted 6208 nonschooling fishes representing at least 52 species from 83 10-min strip transects that covered an estimated 33,754 m2. Rockfishes represented 77\% of the total number of individuals, and included a minimum of 24 species. Six distinct habitat guilds of fishes were manifest from habitat-based clustering analysis: small species were associated with mud and cobble substrata of low relief, and larger species of rockfishes were associated with high-relief structures such as vertical rock walls, ridges, and boulder fields. There was remarkable concordance between some of the guilds identified in Soquel Canyon and the results of other habitat-specific assessments of fishes along the west coast of the United States from central California to Alaska. These generalities are valuable in predicting community structure and evaluating changes to that structure, as well as in applying small-scale species-habitat relationships to broader-scale fishery resource surveys. Additionally, establishment of these groups is critical when incorporating the concept of essential fish habitat (EFH), and negative impacts to it, into the management of fisheries in relatively deep water, as required by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. High numbers of large rockfishes (e.g. Sebastes chlorostictus, S. levis, S. rosenbblatti, and S. ruberrimus) were locally associated with rock ledges, caves, and overhangs at sites having little or no evidence of fishing activity. Abundance and size of several species were lower at fished than at unfished sites. We suggest that rock outcrops of high relief interspersed with mud in deep water of narrow submarine canyons are less accessible to fishing activities and thereby can provide natural refuge for economically important fishes, as exemplified in Soquel Canyon.},

Following the precipitous decline of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) stocks along the Pacific coast, it was evident that more effective methods were needed to assess several species in untrawlable habitats. Cowcod were surveyed within large Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) off southern California using direct observations from the research submersible Delta over eight major offshore rocky banks in depths of 74 to 322 m. Maps of seafloor substratum and bathymetry were used to identify and quantify these areas. A line-transect analysis of fish counts, perpendicular distances of fish from the track line, lengths of survey tracks, and area of each rocky bank was used to estimate abundance. Biomass, calculated from abundance, fish length, and a weight-length relationship, varied with mean size of cowcod on these banks. These fishery-independent results have contributed to the recent assessment of cowcod by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. A time series of results from visual surveys is now necessary to evaluate a trend in cowcod biomass with respect to increased time of protection within the CCAs. © 2007 NRC.},

In this study we tested the applicability of a terrestrial landscape modeling technique in a marine environment for predicting the distribution of ecologically and economically important groundfish, using 3 species of rockfish at Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) as a model system. Autoclassification of multibeam bathymetry along with georeferenced submersible video transect data of the seafloor and demersal fishes were used to model the abundance and distribution of rockfish. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were created using habitat classification analyses of high-resolution (3 m) digital elevation models combined with fish presence/absence observations. Model accuracy was assessed using a reserved subset of the observation data. The resulting probability of occurrence models generated at 3 m resolution for the entire 120 km2 study area proved reliable in predicting the distribution of all the species. The accuracies of the models for Sebastes rosaceus, S. flavidus and S. elongatus were 96, 92 and 92\%, respectively. The probability of occurrence of S. flavidus and S. rosaceus was highest in the high relief rocky areas and lowest in the low relief, soft sediment areas. The model for S. elongatus had an opposite pattern, with the highest predicted probability of occurrence taking place in the low relief, soft sediment areas and a lower probability of occurrence in the rocky areas. These results indicate that site-specific and species-specific algorithmic habitat classification applied to high-resolution bathymetry data can be used to accurately extrapolate the results from in situ video surveys of demersal fishes across broad areas of habitat. © Inter-Research 2010.},

Untrawlable areas, by definition, cannot be surveyed with the bottom trawl; however, there has never been a means of identifying and excluding these areas from relative abundance estimates, which are calculated only from hauls completed in the trawlable portions of each stratum. Unknown amounts of untrawlable habitat are a problem for relative abundance estimation in many bottom trawl surveys. This manuscript describes one method of using the bottom trawling events of a survey, such as ripped-up hauls and abandoned stations, to calculate the amount of area that is untrawlable. A comparison of catch rates between undamaged tows and a limited number of damaged tows, which are normally discarded as faulty samples, showed that Sebastes catch rates were generally higher in damaged tows. Thus untrawlable areas may have substantial importance on relative abundance estimates of Sebastes, the original target species group for this survey.},

	title = {Retrospective analysis of suspiciously small catches in the {National} {Marine} {Fisheries} {Service} west coast triennial bottom trawl survey},
	abstract = {A review of the National Marine Fisheries Service U.S. West Coast triennial bottom trawl survey time series (1977-98) revealed a large number of hauls with unusually small catches, particularly during the first three triennial surveys (1977, 1980, and 1983). Beginning in 1986, technological advances in the equipment that we use to monitor trawl performance have progressively improved our understanding of how our sampling trawl operates. This knowledge has led to a subtle evolution of trawling procedures and probably increased the rate at which we catch benthic fish and invertebrates, making year-to-year comparisons of our survey data more challenging.A minimum catch per unit effort value of a benthic species group (CPUEB ), derived from the most recent and most technologically advanced survey in 1998, was used as a criterion to eliminate trawl hauls with poor bottom contact from earlier surveys. The truncated data sets produce significantly larger biomass estimates, especially in 1980 where 156 of 505 hauls (30.9\%) were removed, with increases of 40\% for Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), 42\% for petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani), and 55\% for Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus). These new estimates are not corrections to standard survey results. Rather, they are most likely under- estimates of the magnitude of how this new interpretation could change the original biomass estimates and abundance trends. Additionally, the CPUEB across each earlier survey was significantly less than in the 1998 survey, indicating that the impact was not just limited to a specific group of hauls with unusually low catches. Total catch of flatfish has also changed substantially during the time series, with the highest catches of flatfish occurring in the recent surveys, and the lowest catches occurring in the earlier surveys. While a switch from a nylon net to one constructed of polyethylene in 1986, and an unusual occurrence of jellyfish schools in 1980 did not significantly affect the CPUEB, there were significant differences associated with different vessel-years. This is further evidence that changes in the CPUEB over the time series is not related to a natural change in the environment or caused by gear differences, but may be linked to changing fishing methods.},

	abstract = {Numerous trawl hauls, made during the triennial bottom trawl surveys (1977-1998) conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service off the U.S. West Coast, had unusually small catch rates of benthic fish and invertebrates (cpueB), probably because the trawl failed to contact the seabed (off-bottom). Technological advances in the equipment used to monitor trawl performance since 1986 have increased our ability to recognize off-bottom tows, and cpueB has risen. As direct trawl performance measurements were not available in earlier surveys, a minimum cpueB derived from the survey with the best monitoring of bottom contact of the time-series (1998) was used as a criterion to eliminate trawls with poor bottom contact from earlier surveys. The truncated data sets produce significantly larger biomass indices, especially in 1980, with increases of 43, 45, and 56\% for Dover sole, petrale sole, and Pacific sanddab, respectively. The analysis suggests that changes in cpueB over the time-series may be related more to changing survey fishing methods than to changes in abundance. Other bottom trawl surveys, which have also added trawl monitoring equipment during their time-series, may have experienced similar changes in trawl performance.},
