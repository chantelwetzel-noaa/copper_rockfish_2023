## Base Model Results

The base model described here is only for the portion of the stock `r spp` in California.  Descriptions of the summed biomass and stock status for the California stock of `r spp` are described in later sections.  

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors (SD column) are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:south-likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals for only the population `r area` are shown in Table \ref{tab:south-referenceES}. Estimates of the `r spp` population size `r area` over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:south-timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

The estimates of growth parameters by sex varied relative to the externally estimated starting values.  The length-at-age 2 and the length-at-age 20 estimates for both sexes was slightly less than the external estimates but were well within the 95 percent confidence interval given the estimated uncertainty (Table \ref{tab:params} and Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). The estimated $k$ for female were greater than the values estimated externally using the survey age data while the male value was similar to the external estimate (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for females and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", 3],3)` yr^-1^ for males).  The majority of female and male `r spp` growth occurs at younger ages, reaching near maximum length by age 10-15, with female `r spp` reaching marginally larger maximum lengths (Figure \ref{fig:mod-est-len-age}). 

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets. The estimated selectivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:est-selex}. The selectivity for commercial dead fleet was estimated to be asymptotic and was parameterized using logistic selectivity. The commercial live fish fishery selects fish at small sizes with dome-shaped selectivity being estimated parameterized using the double normal selectivity curve with SS3. 

Survey selectivity


The catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. The analytical values for catchability were very small given the survey methodologies and are reported in Table \ref{tab:params} in log-space.  Additional fishery and survey index variability, process error added directly to each year's input standard deviation for the were estimated within the model. The model estimated the largest added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_Rec_Private(4)", 3], 3)` for the recreational PR fishery index. In contrast the model estimated only limited additional variability in order to fit the recreational CRFS CPFV fishery index (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CRFS_CPFV(8)", 3], 3)`). The model fit the trends in the `r hkl` index of abundance relatively well with only a small amount of added variance  being estimated to fit this time series (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_NWFSC_HKL(7)", 3], 3)`). The model estimated an added variance of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CCFRP(5)", 3], 3)` and `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Q_extraSD_CDFW_ROV(6)", 3], 3)` to the indices from the CCFRP and CDFW ROV surveys, respectively.

The time series of estimated recruitments and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with the highest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in 2010 and 2013 with the lowest being estimated in 2018 and 2019. There is limited information regarding recruitment prior to 1980 but are estimated in the base model to account for uncertainty around the unfished condition.  The historical age age data from the CPFV fleet from 1975 were identified to have a disproportional influence on estimated recruitment in the late 1960s relative to all other data sources in the model. These data resulted in a sharp spike in recruitment during these years that was substantially higher than any other year in the model.  Given that these estimates were extreme and appeared to be informed by limited data, the decision was made to reduce the influence of this one year of limited age data for model stability (lambda value of 0.10 for these data). Sensitivities showed that the overall ending model estimates were not impacted by this decsion. Estimated recruitment deviations during years with the majority of the compositional data, after 1980, have relatively high uncertainty intervals indicating lack of support for clear strong or poor recruitment years across data sources. Recruitment deviations after 2017 are relatively uncertain but with large negative recruitment deviations. Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in 2021 and 2022  (Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}). The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}.
