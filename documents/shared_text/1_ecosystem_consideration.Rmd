This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors
(other than as they inform relative abundance indices) or environmental factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential ecosystem considerations is
provided below.

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment, or
cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for the `r spp` complex, with only a modest apparent relationship to estimated levels of spawning output. Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements of California Current food webs. Empirical estimates of recruitment from pelagic juvenile rockfish surveys have been used to inform incoming year class strength for some of these stocks, however `r spp` are infrequently encountered in these surveys. Between 1998 and 2013 the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) survey had 34 positive observations of `r spp` out of nearly 505 bongo net tows.
