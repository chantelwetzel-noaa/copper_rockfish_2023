Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Tables \ref{tab:south-reference} and \ref{tab:north-reference}). The estimated sustainable total yields  were `r round(south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2) + round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of unfished spawning output ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) was `r round(south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 2) + round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 2)` million eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning output for the California stock relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output, `r round(100*depl_final, 1)` percent, is above the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl-all}). The fishing intensity, $1-\text{SPR}$, has been above the harvest rate limit ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) in recent years, except 2020 when overall removals declined due to impacts of COVID-19 which reduced recreational fishing effort (Table \ref{tab:ca-status} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). The stock is estimated to be below the management target with fishing intensity exceeding the target across recent years (Figure \ref{fig:phase}). Table \ref{tab:south-reference} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figures \ref{fig:yield-north} and \ref{fig:yield-south} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.
