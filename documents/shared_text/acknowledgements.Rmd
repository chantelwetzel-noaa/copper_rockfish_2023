Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Kayleigh Sommers and Kate Richardson assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in helping the STAT team to understand the data and as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not `r spp` along the coast. Melissa Head provided an area-specific maturity estimate for `r spp` and provided insight in the complex biological processes that govern maturity processes. We thank all of the CCFRP program partners for conducting and providing the available data. Thank you to CDFW and MARE for providing the ROV data and helping us interpret and model these data. This assessment greatly benefited by data collection efforts between the SWFSC and the CPFV fleet (F/V Amigo, F/V Coral Sea, F/V Legacy, F/V Mirage, F/V Salty Lady, F/V Sea Wolf, F/V Stardust) conducted cooperatively with the Sportfishing Association of California that collected critical length and age data used in this assessment.   

This assessment were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar and/or the pre-assessment industry meetings. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, Jamie Diamond, Mike Thompson, Ken Franke, Harison Ibach, Jon Law, Daniel Platt, and others provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the coast of California which were essential in the production of all of the `r spp` assessments conducted this year. 

The assessment was greatly improved through the streamlining of data processing tools (Kelli Johnson and Ian Taylor, NWFSC) and the many discussions within the Population Ecology team in the FRAM division at the NWFSC and the Habitat and Groundfish Ecology Team at the SWFSC.
