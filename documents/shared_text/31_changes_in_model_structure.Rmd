The assessment model structures for both the sub-area south and north of Point Conception have been substantially changed from the structure used in the 2021 assessments. The 2021 assessments were length-based data-moderate assessments which, per the Terms of Reference, assume a more simplified structure and limited data sources. The changes between the 2021 and the base models identified in 2023 are described below.

First, the fishery fleets were broken out into four specific fleets: commercial fishery that lands dead fish, commercial fishery that lands fish for the live market, recreational fishery CPFV vessels, and private/rental recreational anglers. This fleet structure is in contrast to the combined commercial and recreational fleets used in the 2021 assessment. The more disaggregated fleet structure used for the 2023 assessments allowed the model structure to account for varying selectivity and historical management actions that may have impacted the fishery and the available data in specific ways. 

This assessment also included two additional survey datasets that were not included in the 2021 assessments: the CCFRP Hook and Line and the CDFW ROV surveys. Both of these surveys collect data in areas that are open to fishing and MPAs. These data were weighted according the estimates of the percentage of rocky habitat area within open and MPA areas. Using these data in the assessment allowed it to account for dynamics that may not be reflected in the fishery data alone and give a more informed picture of the whole population.

A major change relative to the 2021 assessment is the estimation of biological parameters. Since the 2021 assessments were length-based data-moderate that did not include age data within the models, growth parameters were externally estimated and fixed within the models. This assessment estimates all growth parameters in the model except for the $L_{age=2}$ parameter which was fixed in the model north of Point Conception at the estimated values due to limited observations of length-at-age of young fish leading to high uncertainty within the model. Additionally, the maturity-at-length parameters were updated from the values used in the 2021 assessments. Maturity estimates conducted by Melissa Head (NWFSC) in 2021 were re-evaluated limiting the samples to the fall months when `r spp` are preparing for spawning. The updated length-at-50-percent maturity was marginally smaller for each assessment area compared to the values used in the 2021 assessments.
