The assessment model structure has substantially changed to the structure used in the 2021 assessment. The 2021 assessment was a length-based data-moderate assessment which, per the Terms of Reference, assumes a more simplified structure and limited data sources. The changes between the 2021 and the assessment are described below.

First, the fishery fleets were broken out into four specific fleets: commercial fishery that lands dead fish, commercial fishery that lands fish for the live market, recreational fishery CPFV vessels, and private/rental recreational anglers. This more disaggregated fleet structure allowed the model structure to account for varying selectivity and historical management actions that may have impacted the fishery and the available data in specific ways. 

This assessment also included two additional survey datasets that were not included in the 2021 assessment: the CCFRP and the CDFW ROV surveys. Both of these surveys collect data in areas that are open to fishing and MPAs. These data were weighted according the estimates of the percentage of rocky habitat area within open and MPA areas. Using these data in the assessment allow it to account for dynamics that may not be reflected in the fishery data alone and give a more informed picture of the whole population.

A major change relative to the 2021 assessment is the estimation of biological parameters. Since the 2021 assessment was a length-based data-moderate, growth parameters were externally estimated and fixed within the model. This assessment estimates all growth parameters in the model except for the $L_1$ parameter which was fixed in the model north of Point Conception at the estimated values due to limited observations of length-at-age of young fish leading to high uncertainty within the model. Additionally, the maturity-at-length parameters were updated from the values use in the 2021 assessment. Maturity estimates conducted by Melissa Head (NWFSC) done in 2021 were re-evaluated limiting the samples to the fall months when `r spp` are preparing for spawning. The updated length at 50 percent maturity was marginally smaller than the values used in the 2021 assessment.
