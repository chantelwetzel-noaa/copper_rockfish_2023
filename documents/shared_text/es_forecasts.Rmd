A ten year projection using the combined estimates from each sub-area base model, south and north of Point Conception in California, with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 1 time-varying $\sigma$ with $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2025-2034 is shown in Table \ref{tab:es-ca-proj} (i.e., termed the "buffer"). The removals in 2023 and 2024 were set equal to the portion of `r spp` species-specific adopted ACLs for California determined by summing the adopted ACLs South of \CapeM and the portion of the North of \CapeM allocated to California (25 percent - PFMC Groundfish Management Team pers. comm.). The portion of ACL to allocate to each sub-area was determined based on the proportion of the total removals by area in 2022 (71 percent north and 29 percent south)  as recommended by the GMT (Mel Mandrup, CDFW, personal communication). The projections were conducted in an iterative fashion based on the combined estimates of spawning output, relative spawning output, OFL, and ABC for each year. The estimated ABC was removed from each model area based on the proportion of recent harvests by area (71 and 29 percent north and south, respectively).    

At the end of the projeciton period, 2034, the projected ABC removals maintain the California stock above the biomass target at `r 100*quants[quants$year == 2034, "depl"]` percent of the relative spawning output, with the portion of the stock south at `r 100*round(south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == "Bratio_2034", "Value"], 3)` percent of the sub-area estimated relative spawning output and north of Point Conception at `r 100*round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == "Bratio_2034", "Value"], 3)` percent.

The decision table will be developed at the STAR panel and included in future drafts.
