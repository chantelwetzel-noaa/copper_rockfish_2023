A ten-year projection using the combined estimates from each sub-area base model, south and north of Point Conception in California, with catches equal to the estimated Annual Catch Limit (ACL) based on the category 1 time-varying $\sigma$ with $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2025-2034 is shown in Table \ref{tab:es-ca-proj} (i.e., termed the "buffer"). The removals in 2023 and 2024 were set equal to the portion of `r spp` species-specific adopted ACLs for California determined by summing the adopted ACLs south of \CapeM and the portion of the north of \CapeM allocated to California (25 percent - PFMC Groundfish Management Team pers. comm.). The portion of ACL to allocate to each sub-area for 2023-24 was determined based on the proportion of the total removals by area in 2022 (71 percent north and 29 percent south) as recommended by the GMT (Mel Mandrup, CDFW, personal communication). The projections were conducted in an iterative fashion based on the combined estimates of spawning output, relative spawning output, OFL, ABC, and ACL for each year. The estimated proportion of the ACL removed from each sub-area model was based on the proportion of the contribution to the total annual OFL estimate.    

At the end of the projection period, 2034, the projected ACL removals result in the California stock increasing to be above the biomass target at `r 100*quants[quants$year == 2034, "depl"]` percent of the relative spawning output, with the portion of the stock south at `r 100*round(south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == "Bratio_2034", "Value"], 3)` percent of the sub-area estimated relative spawning output and north of Point Conception at `r 100*round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == "Bratio_2034", "Value"], 3)` percent.

The axes of uncertainty in the decision table are based on the uncertainty around steepness. The estimated uncertainty around the 2023 OFL was used to identify the low and high states of nature that would align with the 12.5 and 87.5 percentiles from the base model where the base model is assigned a 50 percent probability of being the true state of nature and both the low and high states of nature being assigned a 25 percent probability. A search across steepness ($h$) values for each sub-area model was conducted to identify the corresponding steepness values that would create the low and high states of nature relative to the base model. The sub-area north of Point Conception applied values of $h$ of: 0.655, 0.72, and 0.859. The sub-area south of Point Conception applied values of $h$ of: 0.54, 0.72, and 0.929. The proposed decision table assumes full ACL removal during the projection period under P* alternative catch stream (Table \ref{tab:dec-tab-es}).
