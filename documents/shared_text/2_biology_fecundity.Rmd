The fecundity-at-length was based on research from Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for `r spp` was estimated to be equal to `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.
