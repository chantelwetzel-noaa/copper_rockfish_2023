Commercial landings prior to 1969 were extracted from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) landings reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, non-trawl, and unknown gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] were assigned to south of Point Conception in California. Regions 2, 4, and 5 are associated with areas north of Point Conception. Region 6 in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] included Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports north of Point Conception. To allocate landings from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was north and south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition landings in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Landings from unknown locations (Region 0) were allocated proportional to the landings from known regions. 

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-1980 into the CALCOM database [@pearson_reliability_2008]. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1980 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for further details.
Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2022 were extracted from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database (extracted February 6, 2023). Landings were separated north and south of Point Conception based on port of landing. Commercial landings for `r spp` were split into two fleets based on the fish landed condition, live or dead, and aggregated across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The selection of this fleet structure was based on potential differences in selectivity by the fishery based on fish landed condition where the live fish fishery may be targeting fish of particular sizes (i.e., plate sized). The first year where  fish were observed to be landed live for `r spp` in the area south of Point Conception was 1994. 

Discarding was not estimated within the model. The commercial catches, landings plus discards, were estimated external to the model based on data from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The GEMM provides expanded estimates of landings, discard, and catches based on observed trips by sector split north and south of 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. for the commercial fishery. Estimated landings and discards south of 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. from select sectors (LE Fixed Gear DTL - Hook and Line, Nearshore, CS - Hook and Line, OA Fixed Gear - Hook and Line, OA Fixed Gear - Pot, and LE Fixed Gear DTL - Pot) were used to calculate a discard rate (total discard divided by the sum of landings and discards by year) for 2002-2021. The annual discard rates were applied to the total landings by year to calculate catches for both areas south and north of Point Conception. The median discard rate south of 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. from the select sectors between 2002-2021 in the GEMM was 3 percent. This discard rate was applied to landings between 1916-2001 and 2022 to determine catch by year. The assumptions around the discard rate by year had limited impact to the assumed total catches given the limited scale of removals by the commercial fishery for `r spp`. Across all years, 1916-2022, the landings were increased by 2-3 percent by area (11 mt south of Point Conception and 26 mt north of Point Conception) to calculate the total catches.
