The recreational fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, with expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time [@miller_spatially_2014]. Prior to the groundfish fishery being declared a federal disaster in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000. Between 1999 and 2002, gear regulations went from unlimited hooks and lines to one line per person with no more than two hooks, the current 10 rockfish, cabezon, greenling (RCG) bag limit was enacted, and CDFW created  management areas to restrict fishing shoreward of the 20 to 60 fathoms (fm). Depth restrictions ranged from 20 fm in the Northern Management Area (California/Oregon Border to \CapeM) to 60 fm in the Southern Management Area (south of Point Conception, \PtC). The latitudinal boundaries of the managment areas and depth closures have fluctuated since 2002, but have remained fairly consistent since 2011. This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including `r spp` in the remaining open depths. California's network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) also closed approximately 20 to 27 percent of state waters to recreational fishing, with the majority of MPAs developed in 2007.

The depth restrictions have slowly been relaxed following the rebuilding of all previously overfished groundfish species as of 2019, other than yelloweye rockfish (*S. ruberrimus*). The Southern Management area gained access to a depth of 75 fm in 2019, and out to 100 fm in 2021 and 2022. To the north of Point Conception, where yelloweye rockfish are more prevalent, depth constraints persist with most northern areas limited to 30 fm and shallower and more southern areas limited to fishing 50 fm and shallower through 2022.  The recreational regulations for 2023 differ from the most recent years and are described in the management section. 

Prior to development of the live fish market in the 1980s, there was very little commercial catch of `r spp`, with dead `r spp` yielding a low ex-vessel price per pound. `r Spp` were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as incidental catch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.  Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and, rarely, trawl gear. Trawling was prohibited within three miles of shore in 1953 and gill netting within three miles of shore was prohibited in 1994, preventing access to a high proportion of the species habitat with these gear types. 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for fish landed live arose out of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market are lumped into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs.), with small, plate-sized, fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between $5 - 8 per fish (Bill James, personal communication, 2021). `r Spp` is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery. The proportion of `r spp` being landed live vs. dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. 
 
With the development and expansion of the nearshore live fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by a premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. In 2003, CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including the requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain `r spp`, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date.  The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April, and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.
