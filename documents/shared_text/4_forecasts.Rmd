A ten year projection using the combined estimates from each sub-area base model, south and north of Point Conception in California, with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 1 time-varying $\sigma$ with $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2025-2034 is shown in Table \ref{tab:ca-proj}. The projections were conducted in an iterative fashion based on the combined estimates of spawning output, relative spawning output, OFL, and ABC for each year.  The estimated ABC was removed from each model area based on the proportion of recent harvests by area (71 and 29 percent north and south, respectively). The stock is estimated to be above the management target of 40 percent the buffer value in Table \ref{tab:ca-proj} reflects the ABC values with the time-varying scientific uncertainty buffer.

The removals in 2023 and 2024 were set equal to the portion of `r spp` species-specific ACL for California determined by summing the adopted ACLs South of \CapeM and the portion of the North of \CapeM allocated to California (25 percent - PFMC Groundfish Management Team pers. comm.). The portion of ACL to allocate to each sub-area was determined based on the proportion of the total removals by area in 2022 (71 percent north and 29 percent south).
