`r Spp` have not been formally assessed in Mexican waters. Landings data are collected by the federal government agency Mexican National Commission of Fisheries and Aquaculture (CONAPESCA), but catch statistics are not available for individual species.  All rockfish are pooled together into the Rocoto group. A recent publication by @saldana-ruiz_risk-based_2022 conducted a productivity-susceptibility analysis of 531 species found in Mexico. They identified `r spp` in the "low" vulnerability category and as having moderate data quality. The determination of low vulnerability for `r spp` in Mexican waters is in contrast to the findings of a high vulnerability by the U.S. West Coast productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011]. Catches in Mexican waters by U.S. fleets are not included in this assessment.

`r Spp` in Canadian waters are managed as a part of a species complex termed "Inshore Rockfish". Inshore Rockfish are a group of _Sebastes_ species that are caught by hook and line gear in subsistence, recreational, and commercial fisheries. The species included in this management group are yellow, quillback, copper, China, black, and tiger rockfishes. Fisheries and Oceans Canada implement a system of rockfish conservation areas in British Columbia as part of a Rockfish Conservation Strategy. The abundance of rockfish within the Inshore Complex is currently unknown.

`r Spp` extend into the Gulf of Alaska at the northern edge of their range where they are assessed as part of an Other Rockfish stock complex that includes 27 _Sebastes_ species [@tribuzio_assessment_2021]. Within that complex, `r spp` is apart of a sub-complex group termed Demersal Shelf Rockfish with canary, China, quillback, rosethorn, tiger, and yellloweye rockfishes. The most recent assessment conducted in 2021 recommended a reduction in the ABC and OFL for the complex but noted that overfishing was not occurring. 

Off the U.S. West Coast, the portions of the populations of `r spp` off Washington and Oregon were last assessed in 2021 [@wetzel_status_2021-2; @wetzel_status_2021-3]. The estimated unfished spawning output for these areas are substantially lower than the estimated population size off California. In 2021, the Washington and Oregon populations were estimated to be at 42 and 71 percent of the unfished spawning output, respectively.
