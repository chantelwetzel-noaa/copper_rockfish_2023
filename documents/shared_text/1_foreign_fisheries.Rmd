 Copper rockfish have not been formally assessed in Mexican waters. Landings data are collected by the federal government agency Mexican National Commission of Fisheries and Aquaculture (CONAPESCA), but catch statistics are not available for individual species.  All rockfish are pooled together into the Rocoto group. A recent publication by -@saldana-ruiz_risk-based_2022 conducted a productivity-susceptibility analysis of 531 species found in Mexico.  They identified `r spp` in the "low" vulnerability category and as having moderate data quality.  Catches in Mexican waters by U.S. fleets are not included in this assessment.
