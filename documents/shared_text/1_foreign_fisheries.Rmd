_Sebastes_ spp. are not in the Fisheries National Chart (FNC, database containing species status) maintained by the Mexican Government, i.e., they are not commercially harvested in the northwest Mexican Pacific Ocean (E.M. Bojórquez, Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste, S.C., personal communication).There are no data available on `r spp` fisheries off the coast of Mexico. Catches in Mexican waters by U.S. fleets are not included in this assessment.
