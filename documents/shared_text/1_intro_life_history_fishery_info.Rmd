 `r Spp` have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational 
fisheries throughout its range. `r Spp` are a demersal, relatively nearshore 
species within the subgenus *Pteropodus.* `r Spp` range from xxx to xx at depth of   xxx [@love_rockfishes_2002].  The core range is 
comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, with `r spp` 
also found in Puget Sound. `r Spp` are commonly found in waters less than 100 meters in depth 
inhabiting nearshore kelp forests and complex low-relief rocky habitat [@love_probably_1996].
Adult copper rockfish have high site fidelity and do not make long-range movements. 
An acoustic telemetry study displaced `r spp` 4km from their capture location to an artificial 
reef and within 10 days, half of the `r spp` returned to the original capture location 
[@reynolds_application_2010]. 

long the posterior two-thirds of the lateral line. The `r spp` has high variation 
in coloration throughout its range, taking on coloration from dark brown, olive, 
orage-red and pink, with patches of yellow and pink [@miller_guide_1972]. In general 
the `r spp` towards the northern part of the range are often darker in 
color than fish encountered in southern California. The distinct change in coloration 
resulted in copper rockfish described as two separate species, copper rockfish
(*S. caurinus*) and whitebelly rockfish (*S. vexillaris*). 

The *Sebastes* genus are viviparous with internal fertilization, many exhibit 
dimorphic growth with females larger at size-at-age than males, and a number 
of species have reproductive strategies that vary with latitude. There 
are very few fecundity samples from `r spp` available from available from California, 
although `r spp` are assumed to produce a single brood annually. In southern California, 
peak parturition occurs xxxx central California peak parturition occurs 
in February and March.   

The pelagic larvae are encountered in the CalCOFI surveys, but neither larval 
nor young-of-the-year (YOY) can be identified `r spp` visually [@thompson_larval_2017]. The
size at birth ranges from 5-6 mm and the larvae remain pelagic until approximately 22-23 mm 
standard length at which time they recruit to the kelp forest canopy [@anderson_identification_1983].

Juvenile `r Spp` are indistinguishable from kelp (*S. atrovirens*), black-and-yellow 
(*S. chrysomelas*), and gopher rockfish (*S. carnatus*), all of which recruit to the 
kelp forest canopy in the spring months. `r Spp` is the first of the species group to 
recruit to the kelp forest from April to May and can be distinguished from the other 
species once it reaches a size around 50 mm standard length [@anderson_identification_1983]. 
Baetscher genetically identified YOY rockfish from surveys in Carmel and Monterey Bays 
in California and provided the authors with the length and genotyped species idenifications 
from her study [@baetscher_dispersal_2019]. The average length of `r spp` in July was 3-4 cm 
total length \ref{fig:copper-smurf-length}. Anderson observed benthic `r spp` 
nocturnally active over sandy bottom outside the kelp forest [@anderson_identification_1983].

`r Spp` are a relatively long-lived rockfish, estimated to live at least 50 years
[@love_probably_1996]. `r Spp` was determined to have the highest 
vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a 
productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011]. This analysis
calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: 
productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that
characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities. 
 
 As adults, there is little evidence of movement, with  Hanan and CCFRP citations

`r Spp` are opportunistic carnivores and commonly consume crustaceans, mollusks, 
and fish whole [@lea_biological_1999; @bizzarro_diet_2017]. -@prince_food_1972 
observed a shift in a diet dominated by arthropods in age 0 and 1 fish, and a shift to a more 
diverse diet including molluscs and fish as they aged. the study also noted that 
juvenile copper rockfish were predated on by harbor seals and lingcod.
 
There is currently no evidence of significant stock structure from genetic 
studies of `r spp` across the west coast. -@buonaccorsi_population_2002 looked 
at genetic variation across six micosatellite 
DNA loci from samples ranging from British Columbia to southern California. 
Significant population subdivision was detected between th Puget Sound and coastal 
samples and support the model of isolation-by-distance for `r spp`.
@sivasundar_life_2010 conducted a genetic study to determine the potential for 
biogeographic boundaries to prohibit gene flow for 15 *Sebastes* species.
The study's sample sizes of 
`r spp` with samples form Oregon, Monterey Bay and Santa Barbara. @sivasundar_life_2010
used mtDNA and could differentiate samples from Santa Barbara from those collected 
in Oregon and Monterey Bay, but the Monterey Bay and Oregon samples could not be distinguished. 
Micosatellite data did not reveal any genetic differentiation among the sampels from 
the three locations for copper rockfish and suggests low genetic differentiation coastwide. 

The most recent genetic analysis of `r spp` to date was conducted by 
 @johansson_influence_2008. The study included 
749 samples from along the west coast ranging from Neah Bay, Washington to 
San Diego, California with the majority of sampling locations clustered north 
of Cape Mendocino in northern California.  The study included 185 samples collected 
within California. Eleven microsatellite 
DNA loci were analyzed. The study found significant evidence to support isolation 
by distance at the coast wide scale. Weak, but significant, genetic structure was 
identified from samples collected 
along the Oregon coast suggesting that habitat barriers may limit larval dispersal.
