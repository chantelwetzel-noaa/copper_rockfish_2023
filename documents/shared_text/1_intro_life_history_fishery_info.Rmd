`r Spp` have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational 
fisheries throughout its range. `r Spp` are a demersal, relatively nearshore 
species within the subgenus *Pteropodus.*  The core range of copper rockfish is comparatively large, ranging from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, with `r spp` also found in Puget Sound. `r Spp` range from the sub-tidal (as juveniles) 
to depths of 183 m [@love_rockfishes_2002]. `r Spp` are commonly found in waters less than 100 meters in depth 
inhabiting nearshore kelp forests and complex low-relief rocky habitat [@love_probably_1996].
Adult copper rockfish have high site fidelity and are thought to not make long-range movements. An acoustic telemetry study displaced `r spp` 4km from their capture location to an artificial reef and within 10 days, half of the `r spp` returned to the original capture location [@reynolds_application_2010]. 

`r Spp` have a clearly defined long white band the posterior two-thirds of the lateral line. `r Spp` has high variation in coloration throughout its range, taking on coloration from dark brown, olive, orange-red and pink, with patches of yellow and pink [@miller_guide_1972]. In general, the `r spp` towards the northern part of the range are often darker in  color than fish encountered in southern California. The distinct change in coloration  resulted in copper rockfish initially being described as two separate species, copper rockfish (*S. caurinus*) and whitebelly rockfish (*S. vexillaris*). 

The *Sebastes* genus are viviparous with internal fertilization, many exhibit dimorphic growth with females larger at size-at-age than males, and a number of species have reproductive strategies that vary with latitude. There are very few fecundity samples from `r spp` available from California, although `r spp` are assumed to produce a single brood annually during the winter months. 

The pelagic larvae are encountered in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) surveys, but neither larval nor young-of-the-year can be identified visually [@thompson_larval_2017]. The size at birth ranges from 5-6 mm and the larvae remain pelagic until approximately 22-23 mm standard length at which time they recruit to the kelp forest canopy [@anderson_identification_1983].

Juvenile `r Spp` are indistinguishable from kelp (*S. atrovirens*), black-and-yellow 
(*S. chrysomelas*), and gopher rockfishes (*S. carnatus*), all of which recruit to the 
kelp forest canopy in the spring months. `r Spp` is the first of the species group to 
recruit to the kelp forest from April to May and can be distinguished from the other 
species once it reaches a size around 50 mm standard length [@anderson_identification_1983]. 
@baetscher_dispersal_2019 genetically identified young-of-the-year rockfish from surveys in Carmel and Monterey Bays in California and provided the authors with the length and genotyped species identifications 
from her study. The average length of `r spp` in July was 3-4 cm total length (Figure \ref{fig:copper-smurf-length}). Anderson observed benthic `r spp` nocturnally active over sandy bottom outside the kelp forest [@anderson_identification_1983].

`r Spp` are a relatively long-lived rockfish, estimated to live at least 50 years
[@love_probably_1996]. `r Spp` was determined to have the highest 
vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a 
productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011]. This analysis
calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: 
productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that
characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities. 

`r Spp` are opportunistic carnivores and commonly consume crustaceans, mollusks, 
and fish whole [@lea_biological_1999; @bizzarro_diet_2017]. @prince_food_1972 
observed a shift in a diet dominated by arthropods in age 0 and 1 fish to a more 
diverse diet including molluscs and fish as they aged. The study also noted that 
juvenile copper rockfish were preyed upon by harbor seals and lingcod. Two tagging studies of copper rockfish indicated that most individuals have a small home range, with 91% of recaptures from CCFRP (unpublished data) and 49% of individuals from -@hanan_longterm_2012 within 1 km (straight line distance) of the original release site. Of the 117 recaptures from -@hanan_longterm_2012, four traveled greater than 50 km, with a maximum distance of 488 km (1,222 days at liberty), and four individuals crossed the biogeographic boundary of Point Conception. Of the 133 copper rockfish recaptures from CCFRP, four travelled greater than 50 km, and the maximum distanct traveled was 169 km by two different fish (291 and 524 days at liberty). 
 
There is currently no evidence of significant stock structure from genetic 
studies of `r spp` across the west coast. @buonaccorsi_population_2002 looked 
at genetic variation across six micosatellite 
DNA loci from samples ranging from British Columbia to southern California. 
Significant population subdivision was detected between the Puget Sound and coastal 
samples which supports the model of isolation-by-distance for `r spp`.
@sivasundar_life_2010 conducted a genetic study to determine the potential for 
biogeographic boundaries to prohibit gene flow for 15 *Sebastes* species.
The study included 45 observations of `r spp` with samples form Oregon (N = 18), Monterey Bay (N = 18), and Santa Barbara (N = 9). 
@sivasundar_life_2010 used mtDNA and could differentiate samples from Santa Barbara from those collected 
in Oregon and Monterey Bay, but the Monterey Bay and Oregon samples could not be distinguished. 
Micosatellite data did no1t reveal any genetic differentiation among the samples from 
the three locations for copper rockfish and suggests low genetic differentiation coastwide. 

An early genetic analysis of `r spp` was conducted by @johansson_influence_2008. The study included 
749 samples from along the west coast ranging from Neah Bay, Washington to 
San Diego, California with the majority of sampling locations clustered north 
of Cape Mendocino in northern California.  The study included 185 samples collected 
within California. Eleven microsatellite DNA loci were analyzed. The study found significant evidence to support isolation 
by distance at the coast wide scale. Weak, but significant, genetic structure was 
identified from samples collected along the Oregon coast suggesting that habitat barriers may limit larval dispersal.
