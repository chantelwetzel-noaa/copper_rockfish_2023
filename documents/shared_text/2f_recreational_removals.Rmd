The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of `r spp` across California. The recreational catches of `r spp` in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Catches declined in the 1990s and early 2000s (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The removals remained relatively low until the mid-2010s, at which point they began to increase over the last decade, and then sharply declined in 2021 and relatively low in 2022 due to implementation of the sub-bag limit in California for `r spp`. The recreational fishery was split into two fleets based on fishing type (termed 'modes'), a commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV, party/charter mode) fleet and a combined private or rental boats (PR mode). Shoreside fishing (man-made and beach/bank modes) was combined with the PR mode. The catches associated with the shoreside mode for `r spp` are limited and did not justify a separate fishing fleet within the model.

Recreational landing estimates from 1928 to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. The historical landings reconstruction split removals north and south of Point Conception and by recreational modes. CPFV landings of all rockfish were based on logbook data (which do not report rockfish to the species level), scaled by compliance estimates, while total recreational landings from PR vessels were based on a combination of the relative catch rates observed in the CPFV fleet and a linear ramp between catch estimates in the early 1960s and those in the early 1980s (as described in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010]). The species composition of rockfish landings was estimated using a combination of the 1980s Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) data as well as limited CPFV mode species composition data from onboard observer programs in the late 1970s (south of Point Conception) and dockside recreational creel surveys in the late 1950s and early 1960s (north of Point Conception). 

Recreational removals from 1981-1989 and 1993-2003 were obtained from MRFSS downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN). Historically, `r spp` were occasionally referred to as whitebelly rockfish in select California areas. MRFSS catches were pulled for both species names and for all ocean areas. MRFSS includes estimates of removals for 1980. However, due to inconsistencies in the estimates of this year in MRFSS, likely due to it being the first year of the survey with low sample sizes, the value for recreational landings from the historical reconstruction were used [-@ralston_documentation_2010]. 

Some known issues with the MRFSS estimates include 1) a change in the spatial definition of California subregions after 1989, 2) missing or imprecise estimates of catch in weight for some strata that reported catch in numbers, and 3) a hiatus in sampling from 1990-1992 (all modes) and also 1993-1995 in the party/charter mode north of Point Conception. The Stock Assessment Team Members (STAT) attempted to address each of these issues, as described below. The CDFW California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) estimates from 2004 were also included in the MRFSS analysis, as they were not available on the current RecFIN website but are included with the MRFSS catch estimate tables

The MRFSS definition of "Southern California" included San Luis Obispo County between 1981-1989, requiring the catches from this county to be split out and removed from the recreational catch south of Point Conception. The MRFSS catches between southern and northern California were adjusted in a similar fashion as previous assessments split at Point Conception. Albin et al. [-@albin_effort_1993] used MRFSS data to estimate catch at a finer spatial scale from the California/Oregon border to the southern edge of San Luis Obispo (SLO) County. Over the period 1981-1986, numbers of `r spp` landed in SLO County were found to be approximately one third (0.317) of the numbers of `r spp` landed in all California counties north of SLO County [@albin_effort_1993]. Therefore, to approximate catches north and south of Point Conception from 1980-1989, the STAT reduced the ‘southern’ subregion annual catch (which included SLO County) from 1980-1989 by 0.317 during the same period, and added this amount to the northern subregion catch. On average, this ‘moves’ the estimated SLO County catch from the southern region to the northern region from 1980-1989, creating a spatially consistent time series of landings over the entire time series. 

The STAT chose to use catch in terms of weight (WGT_AB1 column) within MRFSS. The catch weights were converted from kilograms to metric tons and any records with missing catch weights were examined. The number of records with missing catch weights for `r spp` in MRFSS were limited (only 18 out of 713). The missing catch weights were imputed based on the number of fish (TOT_CAT column) and the calculated average fish weight by year and area north and south of Point Conception.

MRFSS sampling was halted from 1990-1992 due to funding issues. The survey resumed in 1993 in all modes, except for the PC boat mode which resumed in 1996 for counties north of Santa Barbara County. To produce catch estimates for the missing subregion, mode, and year combinations linear interpolations were used to fill in the missing data. 

Two additional revisions were applied to select years and modes in the MRFSS data based on conversations with California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The catches for the PR mode north of Point Conception in MRFSS for 1981 were 50 to 90 percent greater than the catches in 1980 and 1982, respectively. The high catches in this year were assumed to be a result of issues in the catch expansions due to limited sampling. The catches for the PR fleet were revised downward to be equal to the average removals in surrounding years (1979, 1980, 1982, and 1983). The catches in MRFSS south of Point Conception in 1987 were identified as abnormally low by CDFW (John Budrick, pers. communication, 13 to 27 percent of catches in 1986 and 1988) which was due to no catch information for waves 1-3 (January - June) for either mode. Absence of data in 1987 for these waves was not observed across other rockfish species in southern California indicating that the absence of catch data was likely not due to closures in the fishery. The catches for this year and mode were set equal to the average catch by mode 2 years before and after 1987.

Recreational landings from 2004-2022 were obtained from CRFS available on RecFIN for for all ocean areas. This survey improves upon the MRFSS sampling design, employing higher sampling rates and producing estimates with finer spatial and temporal resolution. CRFS also employs onboard CPFV observers, providing spatially referenced, drift-level estimates of catch and discard for a subset of anglers on observed groundfish trips. Any CRFS records of fish caught in Mexican waters were removed and catch estimates were split north and south of Point Conception for each fleet. Due to database issues, catches for 2004 are currently not available on RecFIN. The catches for this year were set equal to data pulled in 2021 for the previous assessment of `r spp`. 

Adjustments to the recreational catches for 2020-2022 were provided directly by CDFW to account for sampling issues due to COVID-19. During 2020, dockside sampling by observers was halted April through June leading to missing catch data within the CRFS database for this period. CDFW provided proxy catch values for these months directly by CRFS district (personal communication, Melanie Parker, CDFW). The total proxy catches south of Point Conception (districts 1 and 2) for these months were 18.9 mt and 15.0 mt north of Point Conception in California (districts 3 - 6). These catches were split by mode (CPFV and PR) equally for both areas, noting that effort by mode during this period varied across district based on varying COVID-19 restrictions. When sampling resumed in 2020 a large number of rockfish catches were not identified to species, and rather were recorded as _Sebastes_ genus, for the remainder of 2020 and 2021 due to social distancing for health and safety. The second adjustment to catches was to allocate some of those unidentified rockfish catches to specific species. CDFW provided estimates of catch values that allocated a subset of the _Sebastes_ genus removals by recreational mode north and south of Point Conception for these years to `r spp`. Finally, the completed catch estimates for 2022 were not available within CRFS on RecFIN by the data deadline for this assessment and estimates were provided directly to the STAT from CDFW. 

MRFSS and CRFS both provide estimates of total mortality which combine observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish using depth-dependent mortality rates. While the recreational removals from the historical reconstruction from 1928-1980 account for only landed fish. There is limited information on historical discarding in the recreational fishery. A report by Miller and Gotshall [-@miller_ocean_1965] looked at the number of retained and discarded fish in the recreational fishery in California for a select year which showed essentially no discarding of `r spp`. Based on this information, no additional discards were applied to the historical data between 1926-1980.
