This assessment models the sub-areas north and south of Point Conception as separate non-mixing sub-populations, but there is likely larval or juvenile dispersal, and potentially some adult movement, among these areas. Dispersal and movement rates are not well known. Improved understanding around the dispersal rates of `r spp` across California, particularly around the Point of Conception, are needed to support spatial modeling of the stock. 

The primary fishery-independent survey for West Coast groundfish, the NWFSC WCGBT survey, does not sample rocky habitats where most `r spp` are found, and thus does not provide a robust index of abundance. An alternative survey, the CCFRP Hook and Line survey, provides a reasonable signal for `r spp`, including relative abundance and demographic structure inside and outside a number of MPAs. 

Age data are limited and consequently growth estimates are uncertain and the available age data had little to no information to support the estimation of natural mortality. There is a tension among limited data sources and types inferred by the likelihood profiles, with age data suggesting a higher natural mortality rate and length data suggesting a lower value, particularly for the area north of Point Conception. This is opposite the pattern commonly observed in, very generally speaking, many other West Coast groundfish assessments.

Each of the sub-area models estimates high recruitment events over the most recent decade, especially relative to previous time periods. The base model for the sub-area north of Point Conception estimated overall lower variation in recruitment relative to the model south of Point Conception. Oceanographic conditions likely drive periods of either poor or above average recruitment, particularly for rockfish species. However, it is unclear what conditions may be contributing to the differing levels of recruitment variation across the California coast.
