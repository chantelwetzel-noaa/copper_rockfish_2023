This assessment models the sub-areas north and south of Point Conception as separate non-mixing sub-populations, but there is likely larval or juvenile dispersal, and potentially some adult movement among these areas. Dispersal and movement rates are not well known. Improved understanding around the dispersal rates of `r spp` across California, particularly around Point Conception, are needed to support spatial modeling of the stock. 

The primary fishery-independent survey for West Coast groundfish, the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (WCGBT) survey, does not sample rocky habitats where most `r spp` are found, and thus does not provide a robust index of abundance. An alternative survey, the CCFRP Hook and Line survey, provides a reasonable signal for `r spp`, including relative abundance and demographic structure inside and outside a number of Marine Protect Areas (MPAs). 

Age data are limited and consequently growth estimates are uncertain and the available age data contained little to no information to support the estimation of natural mortality. There is some tension among limited data sources and types inferred by the likelihood profiles, with age data suggesting a higher natural mortality rate and length data suggesting a lower value, particularly for the area north of Point Conception. Conflicting signals in the information between length and age data is commonly encountered for many West Coast groundfish stock assessments. The mechanisms driving these differences are uncertain. 

Each of the sub-area models estimates high recruitment events over the most recent decade, especially relative to previous time periods. The base model for the sub-area north of Point Conception estimated overall lower variation in recruitment relative to the model south of Point Conception. Oceanographic conditions likely drive periods of either poor or above average recruitment, particularly for rockfish species. However, it is unclear what conditions may be contributing to the differing levels of recruitment variation across the California coast.
