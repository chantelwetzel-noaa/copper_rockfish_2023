A decision was made by the STAT after discussions with the Pacific Fishery Management Councilâ€™s Groundfish Management Team 
and Groundfish Advisory Panel to model the areas north and south of Point Conception independently for a number of reasons. 
These included a discussion of the evidence of a change in growth with latitude and the fundamental differences in the fisheries 
north and south of Point Conception.  The preliminary exploration of length data also suggested 
that the size composition of landed fish north and south of Point Conception differed in boht the commercial and recreational 
fleets. The STAT maintained consistency across the two models when the data supported the decisions, i.e., maintaining the same 
recreational and commercial fleet structures and sharing biological data across models when appropriate.

The structure of the California models north and south of Point Conception are very similar. Population dynamics in both regions 
operate on an annual time step and are initialized from an unfished equilibrium condition in 1916. Sex-specific age and length 
structure is modeled from age 0 (recruitment age) to an accumulator age (plus group) of 50, with 1-cm population length bins 
ranging from 10-58 cm. Length data bins are 2-cm wide, and range from 8-70 cm in the south and 10-54 cm in the north. 
Expected recruitment is assumed to follow a Beverton-Holt function of spawning output, with lognormally-distributed recruitment 
deviations. Growth (male and female) is modeled using the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, with two estimated 
lengths (ages 2 and 20) and a growth rate coefficient (*k*). The major differences between the two models are the availability of 
fishery-independent data sources that are region-specific, and the parameterization of male growth and mortality parameters (details below).


The models in both regions are conditioned on catches from the commercial and recreational sectors. The commercial sector is divided into 
two fleets, one representing fish landed for the live-fish market and the second representing all other landings. 
The recreational sector was divided into four fleets according to boat mode (party/charter or private/rental) and includes both retained and 
discarded catch. The the ability to accurately estimate a retention curve is complicated by depth-dependent discard mortality rates.

`r Spp` is a desirable species and discards are a small component of total fishing mortality in both the commercial and recreational 
sectors. **The commercial catches do not include dead discards, which were estimated to be a small percent of the overall landings in both 
areas (averaging xx mt coastwide since 2015, although increasing since 2017). In addition, there were very few observations available 
from WCGOP (fewer than xx fish statewide).** The size distribution of recreational discards from the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer 
programs represented smaller fish than those retained prior to the one fish sub-bag for `r spp` enacted in January 2023.
