A decision was made by the STAT after discussions with the Pacific Fishery Management Councilâ€™s Groundfish Management Team 
and Groundfish Advisory Panel to model the areas north and south of Point Conception independently for a number of reasons. 
These included a discussion of the evidence of a change in growth with latitude and the fundamental differences in the fisheries  north and south of Point Conception. The preliminary exploration of length data also suggested that the size composition of landed fish north and south of Point Conception differed in both the commercial and recreational fleets. The STAT maintained consistency across the two models when the data supported the decisions, i.e., maintaining the same recreational and commercial fleet structures and sharing biological data across models when appropriate.

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:model-structure}. The structure of the California models north and south of Point Conception are very similar. Population dynamics in both regions operate on an annual time step and are initialized from an unfished equilibrium condition in 1916. The model is a two-sex, age-structured model with an accumulated age group at 50 years. Growth and natural mortality were assumed time invariant with constant growth estimated and natural mortality fixed at the median of the prior for both sexes. Sex-specific age and length structure is modeled from age 0 (recruitment age) to an accumulator age (plus group) of 50, with 1-cm population length bins ranging from 10-54 cm in the south and 10-58 cm in the north. Length data bins are 2-cm wide, and range from 10-54 cm. Expected recruitment is assumed to follow a Beverton-Holt function of spawning output, with lognormally-distributed recruitment deviations.

Stock Synthesis estimates growth in the age and size plus group. To avoid issues with additional estimated growth in the plus groups, the selection of the maximum age and length bins were selected to ensure that the numbers of fish in the plus group would be low. Growth (male and female) is modeled using the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, with two estimated  lengths (ages 2 and 20) and a growth rate coefficient (*k*). The major differences between the two models are the availability of fishery-independent data sources that are region-specific, and the parameterization of male growth and mortality parameters (details below).

The models in both regions are conditioned on catches from the commercial and recreational sectors. The commercial sector is divided into two fleets, one representing fish landed for the live-fish market and the second representing all other landings.  The recreational fleets were divided into two groups according to boat mode: CPFV (party/charter) and PR (private/rental/shoreside) and includes both estimated retained and discarded catch. 

`r Spp` is a desirable species and discards are a small component of total fishing mortality in both the commercial and recreational sectors. Estimated discards based on WCGOP were used to estimate discard mortality for both commercial fleets and were added to the landings to estimate total catch. The size distribution of recreational discards from the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs represented smaller fish than those retained prior to the one fish sub-bag for `r spp` enacted in January 2023. The estimates of discard mortality available in RecFIN were combined with retained catch to estimate total recreational landings.
