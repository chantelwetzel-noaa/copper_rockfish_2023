The predicted spawning output for the California stock or `r spp` is given in Table \ref{tab:ca-status} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-all}. The predicted trajectory of spawning output for the stock is generally similar to the trend observed for each area north and south of Point Conception with spawning output declining starting late 1970s when catches across California peaked. The spawning output of the stock declined the the lowest level in the mid-1990s and then began to steadily increase through the end of the time series. The spawning output relative unfished spawning output declined to the stock's lowest point in `r min_depl_year` of `r min_depl` of spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl-all}). After hitting a low in 1994, the relative spawning output of the stock has steadily increased with an estimated final stock status of `r final_depl` in 2023.
