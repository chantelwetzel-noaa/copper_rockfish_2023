The predicted spawning output (in billions of eggs) for the California stock of `r spp` is given in Table \ref{tab:ca-status} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:sb-all}. The predicted trajectory of spawning output for the stock is generally similar to the trend observed for each area north and south of Point Conception with spawning output declining starting late 1970s when catches across California peaked. The spawning output of the stock declined to the lowest level in the mid-1990s and then began to steadily increase through the end of the time series. The spawning output relative to unfished spawning output declined to the stock's lowest point in `r min_depl_year` at `r round(100*min_depl,1)` percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl-all}). After hitting a low in 1994, the relative spawning output of the stock has steadily increased with an estimated final stock status of `r 100 * depl_final` percent of unfished in 2023.
