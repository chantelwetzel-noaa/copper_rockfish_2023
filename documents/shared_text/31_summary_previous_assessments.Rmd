`r Spp` was first assessed in 2013 [@cope_data-moderate_2013] using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA), a data-moderate approach, which incorporated catch and index data with priors on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status). `r Spp` was assessed as two separated stocks, split north and south of Point Conception where the population north of Point Conception included the population off California, Oregon, and Washington. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock south of Point Conception at 75 percent of unfished spawning output and the stock north of Point Conception at 48 percent of unfished spawning output. 

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2021 using a length-based data-moderate assessment approach that included catch, fishery-independent index data, and length composition data [@wetzel_status_2021; @wetzel_status_2021-1].  The 2021 assessments comprised four regional assessment models for `r spp` with two model-areas within California split north and south of Point Conception. The 2021 assessments estimated $R_0$ and select selectivity parameters with fixed growth and deterministic annual recruitment for the proportion of the population south of Point Conception and annual recruitment deviations estimated in the model for California north of Point Conception. The estimated stock status in 2021 for the portion of the population south of Point Concept was 18 percent of unfished spawning output, while the California portion of the population north of Point Conception was 39 percent of unfished spawning output.
