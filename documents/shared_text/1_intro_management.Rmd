`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes, split at 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. off the West Coast. Each complex, comprised of nearshore rockfish species, is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that is tracked for overfishing. The complex OFLs and ACLs area  determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs contributions for all stocks managed in the complex (North or South).  

The species-specific OFL and ACL contribution for `r spp` that is allocated to California waters, Nearshore Rockfish South and 25 percent of the Nearshore Rockfish North for `r spp`, is shown in Table \ref{tab:ca-management} as well as the total catch, south and north of Point Conception, of `r spp` in California for the last ten years.  Over the last ten years the catches of `r spp` have been below the species-specific ACLs. In 2021 all West Coast stocks of `r spp` were assessed that informed the 2023-24 harvest specifications OFLs and ACLs for `r spp`. In California waters the new OFLs and ACLs for the 2023-24 management cycle were significantly lower than early years, resulting in inseason management action by CDFW for 2022 to reduce removals based on the latest stock assessment.
