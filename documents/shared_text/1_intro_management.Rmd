Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in 1982, `r spp` were managed through a regulatory process that included the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), the California State Legislature, and the Fish and Game Commission (FGC). With implementation of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, `r spp` came under the management authority of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) and were managed as part of the *Sebastes* complex. Because `r spp` had not undergone rigorous stock assessment and did not compose a large fraction of the landings it was classified and managed as part of the "Minor Nearshore Rockfish" group [@pfmc_final_2008].

Since the early 1980s, a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access with specific regulations designed for each component. Limited entry programs were designed in part to limit bottom contact gears and the open access sector includes gears not making bottom contact, e.g., hook and line. Other regulatory actions for the general rockfish categories included area closures and gear restrictions set for the four different commercial sectors - limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl (which includes the nearshore fishery). 

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in the way that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California Legislature and enacted in 1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for nearshore finfish [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. It also gave authority to the FGC to regulate commercial and recreational nearshore fisheries through FMPs and provided broad authority to adopt regulations for the nearshore fishery during the time prior to adoption of the nearshore finfish FMP. Within this legislation, the Legislature also included a requirement that commercial fishermen landing nearshore species possess a nearshore fishery permit.

In 2000, the PFMC's rockfish management structure changed significantly with the replacement of the *Sebastes* complex -north and -south areas with Minor Rockfish North (Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka, International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC) areas) and Minor Rockfish South (Monterey and Conception INPFC areas only). The optimum yield for these two groups was further divided (between north and south of 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat., near Cape Mendocino, California) into nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfish categories with allocations set for Limited Entry and Open Access fisheries within each of these three categories. Species were parceled into these new categories depending on primary catch depths and geographical distribution. `r Spp` was included in the nearshore rockfish category. 

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by the FGC in fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002 which established a set of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the Channel Islands in southern California (which became effective April 2003). The FGC also adopted a restricted access program in December 2002 which established the Deeper Nearshore Species Fishery Permit, to be effective starting in the 2003 fishing year. Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the PFMC and State coordinated to develop and adopt various management specifications to keep harvest within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures, depth restrictions, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal and area closures, depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size limits to regulate the commercial fishery. The MPAs were later expanded under authority of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) enacted in 1999, creating a network of MPAs which went into place in phases beginning with the central coast in 2007, north central coast in 2010, and the south and north coasts in 2012. The implementation of the cowcod conservation area (CCA) in 2001 closed a large area of the Southern California Bight west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands and offshore of San Diego. The CCA prohibited retention of groundfish, except for some take of nearshore species in depths less than 20 fm around islands and banks, and later, less than 40 fm. The rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) are seasonally adjusted depth limits impacting trawl and non-trawl gears that were initially established in 2002 to protect overfished species. The RCAs also restricted catch of nearshore species to depths less than 30 fm, and in some areas along California to less than 20 fm. Thus, the MPAs, CCAs and RCAs represent three types of spatial and/or depth closures impacting rockfish.

The state of California has adopted regulatory measures to manage the nearshore fishery based on the harvest guidelines set by the PFMC for the minor nearshore rockfish complexes north and south of \CapeM. The complexes are managed based on overfishing limits (OFL) and annual catch limits (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catches) contributions for all stocks managed in the complexes. Limits are shared among all commercial and recreational fleets with the various management procedures intended to maintain removals below the total OFL and ACL for the nearshore rockfish north and south complexes as a whole, rather than on a species by species basis. The nearshore commercial fishery is managed based on bimonthly allowable catches per vessel, that have ranged from 200 pounds to 2,000 pounds per two months since 2000. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed on monthly limits on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300 pounds per month for non-IFQ species, such as nearshore rockfish.  

The species-specific OFL and ACL contribution for `r spp` that is allocated to California waters, Nearshore Rockfish South and 25 percent of the Nearshore Rockfish North, is shown in Table \ref{tab:ca-management} as well as the total catch, south and north of Point Conception in California combined, for the last ten years.  Over the last ten years the catches of `r spp` have been below the species-specific ACLs. In 2021 all U.S. West Coast stocks of `r spp` were assessed that informed the 2023-24 harvest specifications species-specific OFLs and ACLs for `r spp`. In California waters the new OFLs and ACLs for the 2023-24 management cycle were significantly lower than earlier years, resulting in inseason management action by CDFW for 2022 to reduce removals based on the latest stock assessment. January 1, 2022, a statewide commercial sub-trip limit of 75 lbs. per 2-month and statewide recreational sub-bag limit of 1 fish within the overall 10 fish allowed for the RCG complex went into effect.  No change in recreational seasons or depth limits occurred in 2022 but changes were implemented in 2023. In 2022, the Northern and Mendocino management areas were closed January through April and allowed fishing to 30 fathoms May through October and at all depths November through December. The San Francisco and Central management areas were closed  January through March and allowed fishing to 50 fathoms the remainder of the year. The Southern management area was closed January and February and allowed fishing to 100 fathoms the remainder of the year. Beginning in 2023, closed seasons are extended in all management areas. Depth restrictions are eased during some months and tightened in others.These new recreational depth restrictions will be particularly impactful to the CPFV fleet south of Point Conception where it represents the majority of recreational catch.
