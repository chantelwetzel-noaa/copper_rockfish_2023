Natural mortality was not directly measured, so life-history based empirical relationships were used. The Natural Mortality Tool (NMT), a Shiny-based graphical user interface allowing for the application of a variety of natural mortality estimators based on measures such as longevity, size, age and growth, and maturity, was used to obtain estimates of natural mortality [@cope_upgrading_2022]. The NMT currently provides 19 options, including the @hamel_development_2022 method, which is a corrected form of the Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] functional regression model and is a commonly applied method for West Coast groundfish. The NMT also allows for the construction of a natural mortality prior weighted across methods by the user.

@hamel_development_2022 method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments combines meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior for $M$. @hamel_development_2022 method re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015], the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 yr^-1^. The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values. The oldest aged `r spp` observed in California waters was 52 years of age sampled in 2020 in northern California with 15 additional fish aged to be 40 years and older across all data sources.

The maximum age in the model was set at 50 years. This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of `r spp` within California [@love_probably_1996] and was supported by the observed ages that had multiple observations of fish between 40 and 52 years of age.  The 2021 data moderate stock assessments for `r spp` off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California all assumed a maximum age of 50 years [@wetzel_status_2021a]. The oldest aged `r spp` from the 2021 assessment data was 51 years with two observations, one each off teh cost of Washington and Oregon in 2019.
