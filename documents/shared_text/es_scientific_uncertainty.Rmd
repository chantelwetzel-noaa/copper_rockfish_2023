The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning output for the sub-area model south of Point Conception is $\sigma$ = `r round(south_model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty for the sub-area model north of Point Conception is $\sigma$ = `r round(north_model$Pstar_sigma,2)`. The uncertainty around the OFL south and north of Point Conception was $\sigma$ = `r round(south_model$OFL_sigma, 2)` and `r round(north_model$OFL_sigma, 2)`, respectively. Each of these are likely underestimates of overall uncertainty due to the necessity to fix several key population dynamic parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, natural mortality) and no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature).
