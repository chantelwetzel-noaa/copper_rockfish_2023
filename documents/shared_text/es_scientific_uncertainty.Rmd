The model estimated uncertainty around the `r endyr+1` spawning output was for the sub-area south of Point Conception is $\sigma$ = `r round(south_model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and north of Point Conception is $\sigma$ = `r round(north_model$Pstar_sigma,2)`. The uncertainty around the OFL south and north of Point Conception was $\sigma$ = `r round(south_model$OFL_sigm, 2)` and `r round(north_model$OFL_sigm, 2)`, respectively. These is likely an underestimates of overall uncertainty because of the necessity to fix several population dynamic parameters (e.g., steepness, recruitment variance, natural mortality) and no explicit incorporation of model structural uncertainty (although see the decision table for alternative states of nature).
