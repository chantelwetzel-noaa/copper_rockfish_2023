Over the last several decades, spatially explicit management measures at both the state and federal/management council level have been implemented to achieve a wide range of marine resource and fishery management objectives. Depth restrictions to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) and the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs) are key among those, as are the suite of total and partial exclusion of commercial and recreational fishing activities in the California statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). While the former are associated with explicit fisheries management objectives, the latter have a suite of ecological and economic objectives, most of which are not specific to, nor integrated across, the fisheries management arena. Despite this, both types of spatial management measures are expected to result in various biological, ecological, and socioeconomic effects within and adjacent to their boundaries. All of these effects have the potential to influence the nature and quality of the data used to inform stock assessments of species that reside in these areas, including `r spp``.

Regardless of the management objective, spatial closures are expected to increase the spatial heterogeneity in abundance and size or age structure of fished stocks. This greater spatial variability can complicate the assumptions made in stock assessment models, particularly the assumption that the densities and demographic structure of assessed populations are relatively homogeneous, at least across predictable habitat types such as bathymetric gradients or substrate types [@punt_effects_2004; @berger_space_2017]. Although a wide range of factors above and beyond spatial management measures can also lead to violations of those assumptions, and the challenge is intuitively less problematic for populations with high movement rates and/or high population turnover, the challenge can be particularly important for longer lived populations with lower movement rates. The challenge can best be summarized by the result that the more effective MPAs or other closed areas are at protecting populations within them, the more likely it is that traditional assessment approaches will be biased or more uncertain.

If the spatial closures also prevent fisheries independent surveys from evaluating the relative abundance and demographic structure of managed populations, the challenges in developing robust population models, and thus robust management advice, become even more severe. While spatially explicit assessment models provide a means of more explicitly addressing these challenges, such models are computationally intensive, require robust data from the specific areas being modeled, and may also require detailed information regarding movement and dispersal rates [@mcgilliard_accounting_2014; @berger_space_2017; @cadrin_defining_2020; @punt_essential_2020]. Moreover, the complexity of these spatial models increases substantially if the size and location of closed areas changes over time, as many of the more “fisheries management based” closures (e.g., RCAs) have in California groundfish fisheries. Thus, such approaches may be less feasible for more data limited stocks, such as northern and southern `r spp`, at least in the near term. However, the fact that both the northern and southern assessment models are informed by fishery-independent surveys that include habitats both inside and outside area closures provides some hope for greater recognition of spatial factors in future assessments.
