There were some major sources of uncertainty within the assessments for `r spp`. To improve our understanding of the `r spp` stock in California waters the following research and data collection should be prioritized:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item  The NWFSC Hook and Line survey is the only long-term fishery-independent survey in rocky (untrawlable) habitat in the Southern California Bight. Efforts should continue to explore how best to model hook and line catch data to develop indices of abundance. We also recommend evaluating how to structure the NWFSC Hook and Line survey index, given its expansion into the CCAs and increase in sites within designated MPAs, and independent analysis of information content in NWFSC Hook and Line survey across observed species. Finally, increased spatiotemporal sampling around Point Conception would aid in identifying stock boundaries.

    \item The assessment area south of Point Conception appears to have a mixture of observations from areas experiencing variable fishing mortality. In the region there are likely a mixture of areas: open access rocky reefs that are close to port that are heavily fished, open access rocky reefs that are inaccessible via day-trips that are fished but likely at lower levels, and rocky reefs that fall within marine protected areas (MPAs). A spatially-explicit assessment model may be able to capture this complexity but will require data (indices of abundance and composition data) from each of the regions. 
	
    \item Future nearshore assessments would greatly benefit from additional CDFW ROV surveys which could increase the power of these data to inform assessments.

    \item There are very limited age data for `r spp` across California arising from fishery-dependent sources. Establishing regular collections of otoliths from the recreational fishery, a large source of mortality, would support future assessments and would improve the understanding of the population structure and life history of `r spp`. 

    \item There is limited information for `r spp` on maturity and fecundity and the variability of these parameters with increasing latitude.  The NWFSC WCGBT and Hook and Line surveys provided the only available information on the maturity ogive and the timing of these surveys does not overlap with the expected peak spawning season. The Southwest Fisheries Science Center has egg samples from a total of ten copper rockfish, which is too few to draw conclusions regarding fecundity.

    \item Some of the PR mode recreational data that should be available via RecFIN were found to contain information in that database inconsistent with datasheets available from CDFW. There is also a question if length data collected by the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey is duplicated within RecFIN and attributed to MRFSS dockside samples of the CPFV fleet.

    \item The interpreted substrate data for the areas north of Point Conception within state waters is incomplete. Additional data needs include high resolution interpreted substrate maps for areas outside of state waters. The available interpreted bathymetry data from south of Point Conception is incomplete within state waters  around the northern and southern Channel Islands. This poses a challenge for estimating available rocky substrate both by district and also inside and outside closed areas. 

    \item The genetic stock structure of `r spp` warrants further investigation to ensure appropriate management of `r spp` along the West Coast. 

    \item The Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) index was excluded from both California assessment models. The standardized trends in abundance were marked by extreme peaks in the data throughout the time series. The STAT was unable to identify what may driving extreme changes fishing behavior in these select years. These data should be reviewed to better understand whether these data reflect true changes in fishing behavior in those years or errors in data collection. 

    \item Additional research on the effect of the MPA network on `r spp` and other nearshore rockfish species needs to be conducted. The trend inside the MPAs in northern California exhibited an increasing trend compared to outside the MPAs, similar to what was observed during the 2021 assessment of vermilion/sunset rockfish. However, the trends inside MPAs south of Point Conception varied by location with a number of sites showing flat or declining trends.  

    \item Further investigations of other available fishery-independent data such as the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) kelp forest index would benefit future assessments of nearshore species, including copper rockfish. 

    \item Larval and smaller young-of-the-year copper rockfish can only be identified with certainty genetically. Existing sources of data (CalCOFI and Standard Monitoring Units for the Recruitment of Fishes [SMURFs]) where genetic samples can be analyzed would provide key information to inform spawning output estimates for copper rockfish.
 
    \item Continue to improve historical catch reconstructions, including attempting to quantify uncertainty with these and other historical data.
  
    \item Existing catch estimates within Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN) that are currently assigned only to "rockfish, general" should be investigated to determine if these removals can be assigned to specific species.
