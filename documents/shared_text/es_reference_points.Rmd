Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the final year of each sub-area model, `r endyr`. Reference points are presented in Tables \ref{tab:south-referenceES} and \ref{tab:north-referenceES} for each sub-model area and are informational only. `r Spp` off the California coast are managed as a single stock by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Combined reference point quantities for the California stock are shown in Table \ref{tab:ref-point-all-es}.

Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) across California is estimated to  `r round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value']  + south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished level ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) was `r round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'] + south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 1)` billions of eggs. 

The `r endyr` combined California spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass is at `r round(100*depl_final,1)` percent of unfished, below the management target of 40 percent (Table \ref{tab:es-ca-status}). The fishing intensity, $1-\text{SPR}$, for each model area varied where the portion of the stock north of Point Conception has been below that target in recent years (Figures \ref{fig:es-1-spr} and \ref{fig:es-phase}). In contrast, the fishing intensity south of Point Conception has been estimated to be above the target in recent years. 

Tables \@ref(tab:south-referenceES) and \ref{tab:north-referenceES} show the full suite of estimated reference points for each sub-area model and Figures \ref{fig:south-es-yield} and \ref{fig:north-es-yield} show the equilibrium yield curves and net production based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.
