Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivities and catch distribution among fleets in the final year of each sub-area model, `r endyr`. Reference points are presented in Tables \ref{tab:north-referenceES} and \ref{tab:south-referenceES} for each sub-model area and are informational only. `r Spp` off the California coast are managed as a single stock by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Combined reference point quantities for the California stock are shown in Table \ref{tab:ref-point-all-es}.

Sustainable total yield (landings plus discards) across California is estimated to  `r round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value']  + south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished level ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(north_model$derived_quants[north_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'] + south_model$derived_quants[south_model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_Btgt', 'Value'], 1)` million eggs. 

The `r endyr` combined California spawning biomass relative to unfished equilibrium spawning biomass was above the management target of 40 percent at `r depl_final` of unfished levels (Table \ref{tab:es-ca-status}. The fishing intensity, $1-\text{SPR}$ for each model area varied where the portion of the stock north of Point Conception has been below that target in recent years, except for 2020 when the fishing intensity was just above the target (Figures \ref{fig:es-1-spr} and \ref{fig:es-phase}). In contrast, the fishing intensity south of Point Conception has been estimated to be above the target in recent years. 

Tables \@ref(tab:north-referenceES) and \ref{tab:south-referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for each sub-area model and Figures \ref{fig:south-es-yield} and \ref{fig:north-es-yiedl} show the equilibrium yield curves and net production based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.
