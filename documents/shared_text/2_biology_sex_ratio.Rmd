There were limited sex-specific observations by length or age of young fish across biological data sources. The NWFSC WCGBT survey had the highest frequency of small fish observed. However, many of the small fish observed by the survey were too small for sex determination (Figure \ref{fig:frac-sex-len}). In the absence of evidence of a differential sex ratio at birth the sex ratio of young fish was assumed to be 1:1.
