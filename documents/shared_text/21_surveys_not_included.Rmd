### Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans
*add citation*
The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) is an 
academic consortium conducting monitoring of coastal ecosystems in California as 
well as research to support marine protected area design.  Their work includes SCUBA 
surveys and fish recruitment monitoring within rocky reef habitats at a suite of sites 
across the state using standardized protocols so that multiple participating universities 
collect compatible data. 

#### SCUBA Fish Transects
We examined fish transect data collected by participating PISCO researchers at 
the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), University of California Santa Barbara 
(UCSB), the Vantuna Research Group (VRG) and Humboldt State University (HSU) for potential 
development of a fishery-independent abundance index for use in the assessment model.  We 
ultimately concluded that the number of detections of `r spp` on transects was too low to 
be representative of relative abundance over time and the spatial distribution of sites
 having `r spp` were not well distributed across the coast.  Below we outline the structure 
of PISCO fish transect data, the procedure we used to filter to include `r spp` habitat,
and resulting sample sizes. Each fish transect location is surveyed by divers who count 
fish within a 30 x 2 x 2-m volume on the bottom, mid-way up the water column, and near 
the surface just below the kelp canopy.  Three replicate transects are performed within
inner, inner-mid, outer-mid, and deep zones of the reef corresponding to depths between 
5 and 20 m.  This results in 12 transect locations per reef site and 36 transect swims 
incorporating the three levels.  Divers count fish by species and estimate sizes.  
Survey sites are typically grouped within a geographic area, i.e., there are three 
sites on Naples reef near Santa Barbara (Naples Central, Naples East, and Naples West).  

The full dataset was filtered for quality and habitat appropriate for `r spp`. 
Data was limited to surveys conducted by UCSC and UCSB because `r spp` were not 
observed by HSU and sites surveyed by VRG typically either saw very few `r spp` 
or were not consistently sampled across the time series.  The UCSC and UCSB campus 
sites were separated to develop two indices for the northern and southern model regions.
We eliminated sites that were sampled in less than 80% of the survey years for each campus.  
`r Spp` were only observed on bottom transects and so mid-water and canopy transects were 
removed.  The inner reef (shallow) transects were removed due to rare `r spp` observations.  
Divers noted approximate water visibility and transects with visibility less than 3 m were 
removed.  We also retained only fish greater than 17 cm to construct an adult index.  





#### Standard Monitoring Units for Recruitment of Fishes

The PISCO program conducts larval fish recruitment monitoring by sampling 
artificial settlement substrates called Standard Monitoring Units for Recruitment
 of Fishes (SMURFs).  Similar to the SCUBA surveys, SMURF surveys are conducted by 
 multiple universities using standardized protocols.  We examined data collected by 
 the UCSB and UCSC campuses in southern and central California.  Surveys by UCSB were 
 conducted between 2000 and 2018 and by UCSC between 1999 and 2016.  Juvenile `r spp` 
 are difficult to distinguish from juvenile gopher rockfish (*Sebastes carnatus*) and the 
 data from UCSB combines counts of these species into a complex.  For this reason, 
 we determined this data to be inappropriate for construction of a `r spp` recrutiment 
 index to be used within the assessment.  While data from UCSC reports distinct counts 
 of copper and gopher rockfish, the concern remains that the `r spp` counts may not be 
 accurate due to this morphological identification difficulty.  Additionally, collections 
 of `r spp` in this data set were very sparse with many years seeing none.  However, 
 an extremely high number were recorded for 2016.  

### Reef Check

Reef Check is an international non-profit organization leading citizen scientists 
to monitor reef habitats.  Data from SCUBA surveys of fish in California are available 
since 2006.  Given the low proportion of `r spp` detections on PISCO surveys, we did not 
dedicate time to analysis of Reef Check survey data for the purpose of abundance index d
evelopment.  However, given the wide distribution of Reef Check survey sites, the data 
may warrant further exploration for future assessments.
