\section{Appendix C. California Onboard CPFV Index of Abundance}\label{onboard-cpfv-index}}

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling program in 1999 (Monk et al. 2014). California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) has conducted an independent onboard sampling program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows the protocols established in Reilly et al. (1998). During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records locationspecific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.

The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for copper rockfish. Cal Poly has modified protocols reflect sampling changes that CDFW has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at the level of a fisher's bag. Therefore, the Cal Poly data area incorporated in the same index as the CDFW data from 1999-2019. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.

The CRFS onboard observer data went through a QA/QC process at the SWFSC which included mapping fishing drifts in ArcPro to determine if the recorded latitude and longitude were correct.

In the assessment model, the recreational CPFV fleet is modeled as retained plus discarded fish. The proportion of observed discarded copper rockfish is small, averaging 3.5\% over the time series (\ref{tab:onboard-keepdiscard}) and are included in the index.

As described above the CDFW and Cal Poly onboard observer programs are identical in that the same protocols are followed. The only difference is that Cal Poly measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and CDFW measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. CDFW measures retained fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level.\\
Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The data went through a QA/QC process at the SWFSC which included mapping fishing drifts in ArcPro to determine if the recorded latitude and longitude were correct.

We applied a number of data filters to the available data presented in Table \ref{tab:onboard-filter}. The onboard CPFV index restricts the time series to 2004-2019. The onboard observer survey began in 1999, but the sample sizes were small during the first years of the program. The years 1999-2003 also represent years where a number of regulations changed including gear limits, bag limits, and spatial closures. Due to COVID-19, no onboard sampling took place in 2020. In 2021 the onboard sampling resumed in August, but not at full capacity. The 2021 stock assessment had also been released by August 2021 indicating the stock was below the biomass at 40\%. The southern California CPFV began an organized effort to avoid copper rockfish and encourage their clientele to release and descend copper rockfish when encountered. The northern California fleet also participated in this effort to an extent. In 2022, the CDFW implemented the one copper rockfish sub-bag limit and combined with avoidance by the fleet, does not represent the available copper rockfish biomass. See the online supplementary material or the history of regulation changes section for details.

The filters also included removal of the number of observed anglers and time fished at the tail ends of the distributions, removal of drifts occurring in depths outside copper rockfish's range (Table \ref{tab:onboard-filter} and Figure \ref{fig:onboard-depths}). We retained 17,458 drifts for index standardization, and 3,303 of those drifts encountered copper rockfish Table \ref{tab:onboard-percentpos}.

We modeled catch per angler minutes fished (CPUE) by fishing drift. Prior to any modeling, the SWFSC QA/QC'd the data to ensure the location information was correct. Each drift was overlaid with the available interpreted substrate layer that characterizes rocky and hard substrate, assigned to a rocky reef and the distance of the drift start location calculated. In addition, the depth of the start location was interpreted from the 2 m resolution bathymetry as well as 90 m resolution bathymetry layer for comparison. For drifts missing depth location, we assigned depth based on the best available depth based on the bathymetry.

To appropriately weight the onboard observer survey index by the available rocky substrate within a region, each drift was assigned to the closest area of rocky habitat. Hard bottom was extracted from the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}, along the mainland coast of southern California. These data were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters, but did not extend into state waters past the mainland coast. Additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as rock or soft bottom were compiled by analysts at the University of California Santa Cruz and are now also available from CDFW's website. We used the available interpreted rocky substrate data to expand the known area of rocky substrate to areas in southern California that lack substrate type. This expansion of the estimated rocky substrate assumes that the proportions of rocky substrate within and outside state waters are similar. Copper rockfish are a nearshore species and the majority of observed encounters were within state waters (Table \ref{tab:onboard-waterarea}). is a course estimation of the amount of rocky substrate, and represents the best available data. The calculations can be found in the online supplementary material. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts north of Point Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths (Figure \ref{fig:onboard-depths}). The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigned to the larger areas considered as a factor in the index.

The covariates explored for model selection included year and four levels region as categorical region (CRFS Districts 3-6), a categorical variable for month, and continuous depth and depth-squared.\\
rends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:onboard-regioncpue}). A year and region interaction was included after visualizing the trends in average CPUE over time, but was not significant (Figure @ref(fig:onboard-average\_cpue\_by\_region)). The full model was selected by AICc and included year, depth, depth squared and region (Table @ref(tab:onboard-model\_selection)).

Indices were fit via MLE from the sdmTMB package in R. The QQ plot for the negative binoimal model indicated a poor fit to the data, which as not surprising given the low percent of observed drifts encountering copper rockfish. A delta-Lognormal was selected over a delta-gamma by a delta AIC of 487. The QQ plot indicated a much improved fit compared to the negative binomial model (Table \ref{fig:onboard-qq}). The relative abundance is relatively flat during the time series, with a visible increase in CPUE in 2017 when deeper waters opened in portions of northern California after a 17 year closure (Table \ref{tab:onboard-index} and Figure \ref{fig:onboard-index}).

\section{Appendix D. Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Onboard CPFV Index of Abundance}\label{dwv-cpfv-index}}

The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted by CDFW survey in California north of Point Conception from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, (\textbf{Reilly1998?}). During an onboard observer trip the sampler rode along on the CPFV and recorded location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop. The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location. The sampler also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measured retained and discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database (\textbf{Monk2016?}). The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop were recorded at a finer scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch information. Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the vessel is available. We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore excluded from the analysis (Table \ref{tab:deb-filte}). Sampling targeted areas of central California. Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of those launched from port in District 6, the most northern district in California.

Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}. Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; the California/Oregon border to San Francisco (V1), San Francisco to Moss Landing (V2), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V3), San Luis Obispo county to Point Conception (V4). The ports in San Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic mean of CPUE by year was higher also higher in this area (Figure \ref{fig:fig-areacpue-debwv})

The filters also included removal of the number of observed anglers and time fished at the tail ends of the distributions, removal of drifts occurring in depths outside copper rockfish's range (Table \ref{tab:deb-filter} and Figure \ref{fig:deb-depths}). We retained 5,546 drifts for index standardization, with 1,389 fishing location encountering copper rockfish.\\
Tables of the number of samples and positive observations by factors depth, region and year, can be found in Tables \ref{tab:deb}, \ref{tab:tab-region-debwv}, and \ref{tab:tab-year-debwv}.

We modeled catch per angler hour fished (CPUE) by fishing stop where the angler hours were summed across drfts at a fishing stop. To explore weighting of the onboard observer survey index by the available rocky substrate within a region, each drift was assigned to the closest area of rocky habitat. Hard bottom was extracted from the \href{http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html}{California Seafloor Mapping Project}, along the mainland coast of southern California. These data were collected in state waters at a resolution of two meters, but did not extend into state waters past the mainland coast. Additional interpreted bathymetric data classifying the bottom type as rock or soft bottom were compiled by analysts at the University of California Santa Cruz and are now also available from CDFW's website. We used the available interpreted rocky substrate data to expand the known area of rocky substrate to areas in southern California that lack substrate type. This expansion of the estimated rocky substrate assumes that the proportions of rocky substrate within and outside state waters are similar.

The covariates explored for model selection included year and four levels region as categorical region, and continuous depth and depth-squared.\\
rends in the average CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set (Figure \ref{fig:deb-regioncpue}). A year and region interaction was included after visualizing the trends in average CPUE over time, but was not significant (Figure @ref(fig:deb-average\_cpue\_by\_region)). The full model was selected by AICc and included year, depth, depth squared and region (Table @ref(tab:deb-model\_selection)).

Indices were fit via MLE from the sdmTMB package in R. The QQ plot for the negative binoimal model indicated a poor fit to the data, which as not surprising given the low percent of observed drifts encountering copper rockfish. A delta-gamma was selected over a delta-lognormal by a delta AIC of 43. The QQ plot indicated a much improved fit compared to the negative binomial model (Table \ref{fig:onboard-qq}). The relative abundance indicates a decreasing trend during the time series (Table \ref{tab:deb-index} and Figure \ref{fig:deb-index}).
